Mbed is an online compiler platform. There is nothing to install, just log in and start coding!
One of the supported boards is the Nucleo-F401RE, which uses the exact same microcontroller as the FEZ. Use it as your target to build and compile to a .bin file, and then follow the [STM32 bootloader](../tinyclr/loaders/stm32_bootloader.md) instructions to generate a .dfu file and upload it to the FEZ. 

This video shows how to use Mbed to program the FEZ (The FEZ and the BrainPad share the same processor).
