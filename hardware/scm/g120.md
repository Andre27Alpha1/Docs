![G120 / G120E](images/g120-noborder.jpg)

G120 and G120E are .NET Micro Framework (NETMF) System on Modules.

* [Datasheet](http://files.ghielectronics.com/downloads/Documents/Datasheets/G120%20and%20G120E%20Datasheet.pdf)

Pricing, purchasing and other information can be found on the [G120 Page](http://www.ghielectronics.com/products/scm/g120) on our main website.

## Getting Started

Options for programming the G120 include the following:

### Microsoft's .NET Micro Framework (NETMF)
We discourage the use of NETMF software on our products in favor of TinyCLR OS. For more information on NETMF you can go to the [NETMF Introduction](../../software/netmf/intro.md) page.  The [NETMF Getting Started](../../software/netmf/getting-started.md) page covers NETMF from setup of the host computer to program deployment on both an emulator and target device.

### TinyCLR OS
TinyCLR provides a way to program the G120 in C# or Visual Basic using Microsoft Visual Studio.  To get started you must first install the bootloader and firmware on the G120 (instructions below) and then go to the TinyCLR [Getting Started](../../software/tinyclr/getting-started.md) page for instructions on setting up the host computer and writing and deploying programs.

#### Loading Bootloader v2
The G120 comes with Bootloader v1 pre-installed. To upgrade to Bootloader v2, follow the instructions on our [Upgrading GHI Bootloader v1 to v2](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/upgrading-v1-to-v2.md) page. To put the G120 into boot mode, set the LDR0 and LDR1 signals low and reset the board. You may have to wait a couple of seconds before releasing LDR0 and LDR1.

#### Loading the Firmware

> [!Tip]
> First make sure you have bootloader v2 loaded. This needs to be done only once.

To activate bootloader v2, hold the LDR0 signal low while resetting the board.

Download the [G120 firmware](../../software/tinyclr/downloads.md#g120) and follow [Loading the Firmware](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.

#### Using Native Code with TinyCLR
TinyCLR OS also lets you use native code that that works alongside your managed application. Native code can be used to provide improved performance or access to advanced features not exposed through TinyCLR. For more information check out [Native Code on TinyCLR](../../software/tinyclr/native/intro.md).

TinyCLR cannot relocate native code, so you will have specify its location in the scatterfile. For the G120, the interop region starts at address 0xA0F00000, and its length is 0xFFF8.

## CAN Bit Timing Settings
CAN bit timing is a complex topic that requires considerable knowledge of the CAN protocol. If you can obtain CAN timing parameters for a device you are connecting to, use them. All nodes on a CAN network must use the same bit timing configuration.

The following values will help you get started if you want to set up your own CAN network. These values were calculated for use with the G120 Development Board with the SN65HVD230 CAN driver chip. These settings should also work with different CAN drivers, but the maximum cable length may be affected.

Note that the Sample Point, Maximum Oscillator Tolerance, and Maximum Cable Length are the result of using the given CAN timing parameters -- you will not need these for your program. Also, Maximum Oscillator Tolerance and Maximum Cable Length are the theoretical maximums and must be tested to ensure reliability. The number of nodes on the network, the type of cabling and termination, and the resistance of the cable may reduce the maximum bus length.
