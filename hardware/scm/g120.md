## G120 Pinout

Many signals on the G120 are multiplexed to offer multiple functions on a single pin. Developers can decide on the pin functionality to be used through the provided libraries. Any pin with no name, function, or note must be left unconnected.

## Footprints

We recommend no traces or vias under the module. Dimensions are in inches.

## TinyCLR OS
TinyCLR OS provides a way to program the G120 in C# or Visual Basic from the Microsoft Visual Studio integrated development environment.  To get started you must first install the bootloader and firmware on the G120 (instructions below) and then go to the TinyCLR [Getting Started](../../software/tinyclr/getting-started.md) page for instructions.

### Loading Bootloader v2
The G120 comes with Bootloader v1 pre-installed. To upgrade to Bootloader v2, follow the instructions on our [Upgrading GHI Bootloader v1 to v2](../../software/loaders/upgrading-v1-to-v2.md) page. To put the G120 into boot mode, set the LDR0 and LDR1 signals low and reset the board. These are conveniently connected to buttons on the Development Board.

### Loading the Firmware

> [!Tip]
> First make sure you have bootloader v2 loaded. This needs to be done only once.

To activate bootloader v2, hold the LDR0 signal low while resetting the board.

Download the [G120 firmware](../../software/tinyclr/downloads.md#g120) and follow [Loading the Firmware](../../software/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.

### Start Coding

Now that you have installed the bootloader and firmware on the G120, you can setup your host computer and start programming. Go to the TinyCLR [Getting Started](../../software/tinyclr/getting-started.md) page for instructions.

### Native Code
TinyCLR OS also lets you use native code that works alongside your managed application. Native code can be used to provide improved performance or access to advanced features not exposed through TinyCLR. For more information check out [Native Code on TinyCLR](../../software/tinyclr/native/intro.md).

The memory area reserved for native code in TinyCLR OS on G120 starts at 0xA0F00000 and its length is 0xFFF8.

## .NET Micro Framework
It is possible to still use .NET Micro Framework (NETMF). Details are on the [NETMF Introduction](../../software/netmf/intro.md) page.  The [NETMF Getting Started](../../software/netmf/getting-started.md) page covers NETMF from setup of the host computer to program deployment on both an emulator and target device.

> [!Tip]
> The v2 loader is needed for TinyCLR OS. Use the v1 loader with NETMF.

## Datasheet
This documentation page replaced the legacy datasheet PDF but it is [here](http://files.ghielectronics.com/downloads/Documents/Datasheets/G120%20and%20G120E%20Datasheet.pdf) for reference.

## CAN Bit Timing Settings

The following CAN bit timing paramaters were calculated for a G120 driving the SN65HVD230 CAN driver chip. See the [Configuring the Bus](../../software/tinyclr/tutorials/can.md#configuring-the-bus) section of the [CAN Tutorial](../../software/tinyclr/tutorials/can.md) for more information.

| Baud | Propagation | Phase1 | Phase2 | Baudrate Prescaler | Synchronization Jump Width | Use Multi Bit Sampling | Sample Point | Max Osc. Tolerance | Max Cable Length
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
| 33.333K | 1 | 12 | 2 | 120 | 1 | False | 86.7% | 0.33% | 2145M
| 83.333K | 1 | 13 | 2 | 45  | 1 | False | 87.5% | 0.31% | 845M
| 125K    | 1 | 13 | 2 | 30  | 1 | False | 87.5% | 0.31% | 545M
| 250K    | 1 | 13 | 2 | 15  | 1 | False | 87.5% | 0.31% | 245M
| 500K    | 1 | 12 | 2 | 8   | 1 | False | 86.7% | 0.33% | 92M
| 1M      | 1 | 12 | 2 | 4   | 1 | False | 86.7% | 0.33% | 18M

*Note: Maximum Oscillator Tolerance and Maximum Cable Length are theoretical maximums and must be tested to ensure reliability.*

## Oven Reflow

The G120 is not sealed for moisture. Baking the module before reflow is recommended and required in a humid
environment. The process of reflow can damage the G120 if the temperature is too high or exposure is too long.

The lead-free reflow profile used by GHI Electronics is shown below. The profiles shown are based on SAC 305
solder (3% silver, 0.5% copper). The thermal mass of the assembled board and the sensitivity of the components
on it affect the total dwell time. Differences in the two profiles are where they reach their respective peak
temperatures as well as the time above liquids (TAL). The shorter profile applies to smaller assemblies, whereas
the longer profile applies to larger assemblies such as back-planes or high-density boards. The process window is
described by the shaded area. These profiles are only starting-points and general guidance. The particulars of an
oven and the assembly will determine the final process.

## G120 Development Board

The G120E Dev Board is an excellent starting point and reference design for anyone interested in evaluating and
developing with the G120/G120E.
