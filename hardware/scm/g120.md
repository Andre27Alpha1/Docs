Pricing, purchasing and other information can be found on the [G120 Page](http://www.ghielectronics.com/products/scm/g120) on our main website.

## Getting Started

Options for programming the G120 include the following:

### Microsoft's .NET Micro Framework (NETMF)
We discourage the use of NETMF software on our products in favor of TinyCLR OS. For more information on NETMF you can go to the [NETMF Introduction](../../software/netmf/intro.md) page.  The [NETMF Getting Started](../../software/netmf/getting-started.md) page covers NETMF from setup of the host computer to program deployment on both an emulator and target device.

### TinyCLR OS
TinyCLR provides a way to program the G120 in C# or Visual Basic using Microsoft Visual Studio.  To get started you must first install the bootloader and firmware on the G120 (instructions below) and then go to the TinyCLR [Getting Started](../../software/tinyclr/getting-started.md) page for instructions on setting up the host computer and writing and deploying programs.

#### Loading Bootloader v2
The G120 comes with Bootloader v1 pre-installed. To upgrade to Bootloader v2, follow the instructions on our [Upgrading GHI Bootloader v1 to v2](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/upgrading-v1-to-v2.md) page. To put the G120 into boot mode, set the LDR0 and LDR1 signals low and reset the board. You may have to wait a couple of seconds before releasing LDR0 and LDR1.

#### Loading the Firmware

> [!Tip]
> First make sure you have bootloader v2 loaded. This needs to be done only once.

To activate bootloader v2, hold the LDR0 signal low while resetting the board.

Download the [G120 firmware](../../software/tinyclr/downloads.md#g120) and follow [Loading the Firmware](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.
