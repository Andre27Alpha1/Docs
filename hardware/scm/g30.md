## Overview

The G30 System on Chip (SoC) is a low-cost System on Chip (SoC)part of GHI Electronics SurfaceMount Compute Modules (SCM). These modules can be programmed in .NET C# and Visual Basic using TinyCLR OS or .NET Micro Framework.

Pricing, purchasing and other information can be found on the [G30 Page](http://www.ghielectronics.com/products/scm/g30) on our main website.

## Footprint

The chip is standard LQFP64 10x10mm. See the ST32F401RET6 datasheet for exact footprint.

## G30 Development Board
The G30 Dev Board is an excellent starting point and reference design for anyone interested in evaluating and developing with the G30.

## TinyCLR OS
TinyCLR OS provides a way to program the UC5550 in C# or Visual Basic from the Microsoft Visual Studio integrated development environment.  To get started you must first install the bootloader and firmware on the UC5550 (instructions below) and then go to the TinyCLR [Getting Started](../../software/tinyclr/getting-started.md) page for instructions.

### Loading Bootloader v2
The G30 SoC ships with the Bootloader loaded and locked. No further steps are necessary.

### Loading the Firmware

To activate bootloader v2, hold the LDR0 signal low while resetting the board.

Download the [G30 firmware](../../software/tinyclr/downloads.md#g30) and follow [Loading the Firmware](../../software/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.

### Start Coding

Now that you have installed the bootloader and firmware on the UC5550, you can setup your host computer and start programming.  Go to the TinyCLR [Getting Started](../../software/tinyclr/getting-started.md) page for instructions.

This example initializes the display and uses some other components.

```cs
// need example for here!
```

### Native Code
TinyCLR OS also lets you use native code that works alongside your managed application. Native code can be used to provide improved performance or access to advanced features not exposed through TinyCLR. For more information check out [Native Code on TinyCLR](../../software/tinyclr/native/intro.md).

The memory area reserved for native code in TinyCLR OS on G30 starts at 0x20016000 and its length is 0x3F8.

## .NET Micro Framework
It is possible to still use .NET Micro Framework (NETMF). Details are on the [NETMF Introduction](../../software/netmf/intro.md) page.  The [NETMF Getting Started](../../software/netmf/getting-started.md) page covers NETMF from setup of the host computer to program deployment on both an emulator and target device.

## Datasheet
