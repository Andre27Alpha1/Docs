# G400S Pinout

Many signals on the G400 are multiplexed to offer multiple functions on a single pin. Developers can decide on the pin functionality to be used through the provided libraries. Any pin with no name, function, or note must be left unconnected.

### G400S Recommended Footprint

![G400S Footprint](images/g400s-footprint.jpg)

## Device Startup

The G400 is held in reset when the reset pin is low. Releasing it will begin the system startup process. It is pulled
high internally

There are four different components of the device firmware:

1. GHI Bootloader: initializes the system, updates TinyBooter when needed, and executes TinyBooter.
2. TinyBooter: executes TinyCLR, updates TinyCLR when needed, and updates the system configuration.
3. TinyCLR: loads, debugs, and executes the managed application.
4. Managed application: the program developed by the customer.

Which components get executed on startup can be control by manipulating the LDR0 and LDR1 pins. LDR0 and
LDR1 are pulled high on startup.

| LDRO               | LDR1      |Effect                            |
|--------------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Ignored            | High      | Execute the managed application  |
| High               | Low       | Wait in TinyBooter               |
| Low                | Low       | Wait in GHI Bootloader           |

Additionally, the communications interface between the host PC and the G400 is selected on startup through the
MODE pin, which is pulled high on startup. The USB interface is selected when MODE is high and COM1 is selected
when MODE is low.

The above discussed functions of LDR0, LDR1, and MODE are only during startup. After startup, they return to the
default GPIO state and are available to use as GPIO in the user application.

## Getting Started

Options for programming the G400S include the following:

### Microsoft's .NET Micro Framework (NETMF)

We discourage the use of NETMF software on our products in favor of TinyCLR OS. For more information on NETMF you can go to the [NETMF Introduction](../../software/netmf/intro.md) page.  The [NETMF Getting Started](../../software/netmf/getting-started.md) page covers NETMF from setup of the host computer to program deployment on both an emulator and target device.

### TinyCLR OS

TinyCLR is our own operating system and provides a means of programming embedded devices using .NET and Visual Studio.  Visual Studio is widely regarded as one of the best (if not the best) integrated development environments available.  The free Community version of Visual Studio can be downloaded here:  [Visual Studio Downloads](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).  For information on setting up TinyCLR to work in Visual Studio please click here:  [TinyCLR Introduction](../../software/tinyclr/intro.md)

#### Loading Bootloader Version 2

Download the [G400 bootloader file](../../software/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md).

Go to the [SAMBA](../../software/loaders/intro.md#sam-ba-bootloader) section of the [Bootloaders Introduction](../../software/loaders/intro.md) page for instructions on loading the bootloader.

#### Loading the Firmware

> [!Tip]
> First make sure you have bootloader v2 loaded. This needs to be done only once.

To activate bootloader v2, hold the LDR0 (pin 101) signal low and reset the board. You may have to wait a couple of seconds before releasing LDR0.

Download the [G400 firmware](../../software/tinyclr/downloads.md#g400) and follow [Loading the Firmware](../../software/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.

#### Using Native Code with TinyCLR

TinyCLR OS also lets you use native code that that works alongside your managed application. Native code can be used to provide improved performance or access to advanced features not exposed through TinyCLR. For more information check out [Native Code on TinyCLR](../../software/tinyclr/native/intro.md).

TinyCLR cannot relocate native code, so you will have specify its location in the scatterfile. For the G400S, the interop region starts at address 0x26700000, and its length is 0x16FFFF8.

## Datasheet

This documentation page replaced the legacy datasheet PDF but it is [here](http://files.ghielectronics.com/downloads/Documents/Datasheets/G400S%20and%20G400D%20Datasheet.pdf) for reference.

## CAN Bit Timing Settings

The following CAN bit timing parameters were calculated for a G400 driving the SN65HVD230 CAN driver chip. See the [Configuring the Bus](../../software/tinyclr/tutorials/can.md#configuring-the-bus) section of the [CAN Tutorial](../../software/tinyclr/tutorials/can.md) for more information.

| Baud | Propagation | Phase1 | Phase2 | Baudrate Prescaler | Synchronization Jump Width | Use Multi Bit Sampling | Sample Point | Max Osc. Tolerance | Max Cable Length
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
| 83.333K | 7 | 4 | 1 | 99 | 0 | False | 87.5% | 0.31% | 845M
| 125K    | 7 | 1 | 1 | 81 | 0 | False | 84.6% | 0.38% | 499M
| 250K    | 7 | 1 | 1 | 40 | 0 | False | 84.6% | 0.38% | 222M
| 500K    | 7 | 7 | 1 | 13 | 1 | False | 89.5% | 0.41% | 92M
| 1M      | 7 | 7 | 1 | 6  | 1 | False | 89.5% | 0.41% | 19M

*Note: Maximum Oscillator Tolerance and Maximum Cable Length are theoretical maximums and must be tested to ensure reliability.*

## Design Considerations

### Required Pins

Exposing the following pins is required in every design to enable device programming, updates, and recovery:
* LDR0
* LDR1
* Reset
* Desired debug interface(s)
* MODE if required to select a debug interface
* SPI1 MISO to update TinyBooter in SDK 2015 R1 and earlier and to install the GHI Bootloader once for SDK
2016 R1 and later

### Power Supply

A typical clean power source, suited for digital circuitry, is needed to power the G400. Voltages should be within at
least 10% of the needed voltage. Decoupling capacitors of 0.1 μF are needed near every power pin. Additionally, a
large capacitor, typically 47 μF, should be near the G400 if the power supply is more than few inches away.
Additionally, the G400 requires additional voltages beyond the typical 3.3 V to function properly. See the pinout
table for details.

### Crystals

The G400 includes the needed system and RTC crystals and their associated circuitry.

### SPI Channels

SPI1 is shared internally with the flash memory on the G400. Use of a chip select with devices on this channel is
required or the G400 will not function properly. The use of another SPI channel is recommended.

### Ethernet

The built in Ethernet available on the G400D includes all needed Ethernet circuitry internally. However, an
appropriate magnet and connector, like the J0011D or similar, are required.

### Soldering the G400S

The G400S is designed to be easily machine-placed or hand-soldered. Static sensitive precautions should be taken
when handling the module.

### Oven Reflow

The G400S is not sealed for moisture. Baking the module before reflow is recommended and required in a humid
environment. The process of reflow can damage the G400 if the temperature is too high or exposure is too long.

The lead-free reflow profile used by GHI Electronics is shown below. The profiles shown are based on SAC 305
solder (3% silver, 0.5% copper). The thermal mass of the assembled board and the sensitivity of the components
on it affect the total dwell time. Differences in the two profiles are where they reach their respective peak
temperatures as well as the time above liquids (TAL). The shorter profile applies to smaller assemblies, whereas
the longer profile applies to larger assemblies such as back-planes or high-density boards. The process window is
described by the shaded area. These profiles are only starting-points and general guidance. The particulars of an
oven and the assembly will determine the final process.
