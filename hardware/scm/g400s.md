![G400S](images/g400s-noborder.jpg)

The G400S System on Module (SoM) is the surface mount version of the G400D.  Originally designed for .NET Micro Framework, it now runs several other platforms including TinyCLR.

* [Datasheet](http://files.ghielectronics.com/downloads/Documents/Datasheets/G400S%20and%20G400D%20Datasheet.pdf)

Pricing, purchasing and other information can be found on the [G400S Page](http://www.ghielectronics.com/products/scm/g400s) on our main website.

## Getting Started

Options for programming the G400S include the following:

### Microsoft's .NET Micro Framework (NETMF)
We discourage the use of NETMF software on our products in favor of TinyCLR OS. For more information on NETMF you can go to the [NETMF Introduction](../../software/netmf/intro.md) page.  The [NETMF Getting Started](../../software/netmf/getting-started.md) page covers NETMF from setup of the host computer to program deployment on both an emulator and target device.

### TinyCLR OS
TinyCLR is our own operating system and provides a means of programming embedded devices using .NET and Visual Studio.  Visual Studio is widely regarded as one of the best (if not the best) integrated development environments available.  The free Community version of Visual Studio can be downloaded here:  [Visual Studio Downloads](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).  For information on setting up TinyCLR to work in Visual Studio please click here:  [TinyCLR Introduction](../../software/tinyclr/intro.md)

#### Loading Bootloader Version 2
Download the [G400 bootloader file](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md#g400).

Go to the [SAMBA](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/intro.md#sam-ba-bootloader) section of the [Bootloaders Introduction](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/intro.md) page for instructions on loading the bootloader.

#### Loading the Firmware

> [!Tip]
> First make sure you have bootloader v2 loaded. This needs to be done only once.

To activate bootloader v2, hold the LDR0 (pin 101) signal low while resetting the board.

Download the [G400 firmware](../../software/tinyclr/downloads.md#g400) and follow [Loading the Firmware](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.
