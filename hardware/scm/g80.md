![G80](images/g80-noborder.jpg)

The G80 System on Chip (SoC) is a low-cost chipset running .NET Micro Framework. It is programmed using Microsoft's Visual Studio in C# or Visual Basic which lets developers enjoy a world class development environment with modern event-driven programming languages.

Pricing, purchasing and other information can be found on the [G80 Page](http://www.ghielectronics.com/products/scm/g80) on our main website.

## Getting Started

Options for programming the G80 include the following:

### Microsoft's .NET Micro Framework (NETMF)
We discourage the use of NETMF software on our products in favor of TinyCLR OS. For more information on NETMF you can go to the [NETMF Introduction](../../software/netmf/intro.md) page. The [NETMF Getting Started](../../software/netmf/getting-started.md) page covers NETMF from setup of the host computer to program deployment on both an emulator and target device.

### TinyCLR OS
TinyCLR provides a way to program the G80 in C# or Visual Basic using Microsoft Visual Studio. To get started you must first install the firmware on the G80 (instructions below) and then go to the TinyCLR [Getting Started](../../software/tinyclr/getting-started.md) page for instructions on setting up the host computer and writing and deploying programs.

#### Loading Bootloader v2
The G80 SoC ships with the Bootloader loaded and locked. No further steps are necessary.

#### Loading the Firmware

To activate bootloader v2, hold LDR0 low and reset the device. You may have to wait a couple of seconds before releasing LDR0.

Download the [G80 firmware](../../software/tinyclr/downloads.md#g80) and follow [Loading the Firmware](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.

#### Using Native Code with TinyCLR
TinyCLR OS also lets you use native code that that works alongside your managed application. Native code can be used to provide improved performance or access to advanced features not exposed through TinyCLR. For more information check out [Native Code on TinyCLR](../../software/tinyclr/native/intro.md).

TinyCLR cannot relocate native code, so you will have specify its location in the scatterfile. For the G80, the interop region starts at address 0x2002F000, and its length is 0xFF8.

## CAN Bit Timing Settings
CAN bit timing is a complex topic that requires considerable knowledge of the CAN protocol. If you can obtain CAN timing parameters for a device you are connecting to, use them. All nodes on a CAN network must use the same bit timing configuration.

The following values will help you get started if you want to set up your own CAN network. These values were calculated for use with the G80 Development Board with the TJA1050T CAN driver chip. These settings should also work with different CAN drivers, but the maximum cable length may be affected.

Note that the Sample Point, Maximum Oscillator Tolerance, and Maximum Cable Length are the result of using the given CAN timing parameters -- you will not need these for your program. Also, Maximum Oscillator Tolerance and Maximum Cable Length are the theoretical maximums and must be tested to ensure reliability. The number of nodes on the network, the type of cabling and termination, and the resistance of the cable can reduce the maximum bus length.
