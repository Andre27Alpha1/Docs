The G80 System on Chip (SoC) is a low-cost chipset running .NET Micro Framework. It is programmed using Microsoft's Visual Studio in C# or Visual Basic which lets developers enjoy a world class development environment with modern event-driven programming languages.

## Getting Started

Options for programming the G80 include the following:

### Microsoft's .NET Micro Framework (NETMF)
We discourage the use of NETMF software on our products in favor of TinyCLR OS. For more information on NETMF you can go to the [NETMF Introduction](../../software/netmf/intro.md) page. The [NETMF Getting Started](../../software/netmf/getting-started.md) page covers NETMF from setup of the host computer to program deployment on both an emulator and target device.

### TinyCLR OS
TinyCLR provides a way to program the G80 in C# or Visual Basic using Microsoft Visual Studio. To get started you must first install the firmware on the G80 (instructions below) and then go to the TinyCLR [Getting Started](../../software/tinyclr/getting-started.md) page for instructions on setting up the host computer and writing and deploying programs.

#### Loading Bootloader v2
The G80 SoC ships with the Bootloader loaded and locked. No further steps are necessary.

#### Loading the Firmware

To activate bootloader v2, the LDR0 input needs to be low while resetting the device.

Download the [G80 firmware](../../software/tinyclr/downloads.md#g80) and follow [Loading the Firmware](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.

### G80 Based products

#### G80 Development Board
