The G80 System on Chip (SoC) is a low-cost chipset running the .NET Micro Framework. It is programmed using Microsoft's Visual Studio using C# or Visual Basic which allows developers to take advantage of the extensive built-in NETMF libraries and GHI Electronics added extensions.

To use G80 SoC, follow the setup instructions on the NETMF [intro page](../../software/netmf/intro.md)

## Using the NETMF software
We discourage the use of NETMF software on our products in favor for TinyCLR OS. [Read more](../../software/netmf/intro.md) about the use of NETMF and TinyCLR OS.

## Using TinyCLR OS
If you haven't yet, read about using NETMF devices [with TinyCLR OS](../../software/netmf/intro.md#with-tinyclr-os)

### Loading Bootloader v2
The G80 SoC ships with the Bootloader loaded and locked. No further steps are necessary.

### Loading the Firmware

To activate bootloader v2, the LDR0 input needs to be low while resetting the device.

Download the [G80 firmware](../../software/tinyclr/downloads.md#g80) and follow [Loading the Firmware](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/ghi_bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.
