## Overview
The efficiency of our UC2550 makes it ideal for low power applications.  It is also our lowest cost UCM and offers a large complement of peripherals.  Unlike the UC5550 however, it does not support USB host, a parallel LCD display, Ethernet PHY, or DCMI (Digital Camera Interface).

We currently stock the UC2550 both with and without Wi-Fi depending on the model. We also offer customized, non-stock versions of our SoMs. See [Options](#options) below for more information. 

## Getting Started
The UCM [development options](development-options.md) can greatly simplify the process of building a product or prototype using the UC2550.  Options include a development board and displays which can get you programming in minutes.  Please refer to the [Development Options](development-options.md) page for more information.

### Using TinyCLR OS
TinyCLR provides a way to program the UC2550 in C# or Visual Basic from the Microsoft Visual Studio integrated development environment.  To get started you must first install the bootloader and firmware on the UC2550 (instructions below) and then go to the TinyCLR [Getting Started](../../software/tinyclr/getting-started.md) page for instructions on setting up the host computer and writing and deploying programs.

#### Loading Bootloader Version 2
Download the UC2550 bootloader from [here](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md#uc2550).

Go to the [Uploading DFU Files](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/stm32-bootloader.md#uploading-dfu-files) section of the [STM32 Bootloader](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/stm32-bootloader.md) page for instructions on installing the bootloader.

#### Loading the Firmware

> [!Tip]
> First make sure you have bootloader v2 loaded. This needs to be done only once.

To activate bootloader v2, hold the LDR0 signal low (press BOOT B on the UCM Dev and Breakout boards) and reset the board. You may have to wait a couple of seconds before releasing LDR0.

Download the [UC2550 firmware](../../software/tinyclr/downloads.md#uc2550) and follow the [Loading the Firmware](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.

#### Setup the Host Computer and Start Coding
Now that you have installed the bootloader and firmware on the UC2550, you can setup your host computer and start programming.  Go to the TinyCLR [Getting Started](../../software/tinyclr/getting-started.md#tinyclr-computer-setup) page for instructions.

#### Using Native Code with TinyCLR
TinyCLR OS also lets you use native code that that works alongside your managed application. Native code can be used to provide improved performance or access to advanced features not exposed through TinyCLR. For more information check out [Native Code on TinyCLR](../../software/tinyclr/native/intro.md).

TinyCLR cannot relocate native code, so you will have specify its location in the scatterfile. For the UC2550, the interop region starts at address 0x2003E000, and its length is 0x1FF8.

### Updating the Wi-Fi Module Firmware
To update the firmware on the UC2550 Wi-Fi module, follow the instructions on [this page](../components/spwf04sa.md).

## Schematic
The schematic for the UC2550 can be found [here](http://files.ghielectronics.com/downloads/Schematics/Systems/UC2550%20Rev%20C%20Schematic.pdf).

## Options
| Model Number | Wi-Fi | External QSPI Flash | 
|--------------|-------|---------------------|
| UC2550-13NNN | no    | no |
| UC2550-13NNW | yes   | no |

### Customization
We also offer customized, non-stock versions of our SoMs. Many options are available, such as various sizes of external QSPI flash. Please [contact us](http://ghielectronics.com/company/contact) for details. We will always do our best to provide you with a module to fit your exact needs.

## CAN Bit Timing Settings
CAN bit timing is a complex topic that requires considerable knowledge of the CAN protocol. If you can obtain CAN timing parameters for a device you are connecting to, use them. All nodes on a CAN network must use the same bit timing configuration.

The following values will help you get started if you want to set up your own CAN network. These values were calculated for use with the UCM Development Board with the SN65HVD230 CAN driver chip. These settings should also work with different CAN drivers, but the maximum cable length may be affected.

Note that the Sample Point, Maximum Oscillator Tolerance, and Maximum Cable Length are the result of using the given CAN timing parameters -- you will not need these for your program. Also, Maximum Oscillator Tolerance and Maximum Cable Length are the theoretical maximums and must be tested to ensure reliability. The number of nodes on the network, the type of cabling and termination, and the resistance of the cable can reduce the maximum bus length.
