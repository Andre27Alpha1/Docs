# UCM Development Options

These options are provided to speed the development of your product and make it possible to start programming your application within minutes without designing or building new hardware.

## UCM Dev Board

The UCM Dev Board is the fastest and easiest way to start using our Universal Compute Modules.  This board provides a socket for the UCM, standard connectors for input/output, and three 40 pin socket headers for connecting peripherals and a display.

Our display modules have mating 40 pin headers. This allows you to mount the display directly to the Dev Board or mount the display remotely using a standard IDE hard drive cable.
  
To start development using the UCM Dev Board, just plug a UCM into the socket on the board and connect the board to a host computer using a micro USB cable. Once you update your device with the latest bootloader and firmware you are ready to start programming!

## UCM Breakout Board

The UCM Breakout Board provides a socket for UCMs, and both through hole and surface mount edge connections for soldering the Breakout Board to your own circuit board.  This board makes it easier to use UCMs in prototypes or products without the need to solder the fine pitch 200 pin SO-DIMM socket to your board. The Breakout Board also provides a USB connector for connecting to a host computer. It does not, however, have a 3.3 volt regulator. 5 volts from the USB connector is available on a pad on the board so you can wire your own regulator.

To get started using the Through Hole Module, it is only necessary to provide a 3.3 volt source and connect the module to a host computer using a micro USB cable. You may wish to wire an LED to one of the output pins to create a blinking LED "hello world" program. Then update your device with the latest bootloader and firmware and start coding!

You can also solder pin headers to the Breakout Board and use traditional breadboarding techniques to build your prototype as well.

## Displays

These display boards are designed for use with the UCM Dev Board and UCM Breakout Board. They have a 40 pin male header connector that mates with the UCM Dev and Breakout boards directly or through a standard 40 pin IDE hard drive cable.
