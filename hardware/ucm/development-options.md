Our UCM development options are provided to speed the development of your product.  These accessories make it possible to start programming your application within minutes without designing or building new hardware.

## UCM Dev Board

The Dev Board is the recommended way to start development as it socketed for G400, provides a USB port for programming from the host computer, and provides connectors for most peripherals as well as optional plug-in displays.

To start development using the G400 Dev Board, just plug the G400D into the socket on the board and connect the board to a host computer using a micro USB cable.  Once you update the G400D with the lastest bootloader and firmware you are ready to start programming




Our UCM Dev Board is the fastest and easiest way to start using our UCMs.  This board provides a socket for the UCM, standard connectors for input/output, and three 40 pin socket headers for connecting peripherals and a display.

Our display modules have mating 40 pin headers.  This allows you to mount the display directly to the Dev Board or mount the display remotely using a standard IDE hard drive cable.
  
## UCM Breakout Board

The G400 Through Hole Module is a breakout board which is socketed for the G400D and provides 0.1" spaced through hole connections around the perimeter of the board.  The Through Hole Module also provides a USB connector for connecting to a host computer.  It does not, however, have a 3.3 volt regulator.  5 volts from the USB connector is available on a pad on the board so you can wire your own regulator.

To quickly get started using the Through Hole Module, it is only necessary to provide a 3.3 volt source and connect the module to a host computer using a micro USB cable.  You may wish to wire an LED to one of the output pins to create a blinking LED "hello world" program.  Then update the G400D with the latest bootloader and firmware and start coding!




Our UCM Breakout Board provides a socket for our standard UCMs, and both through hole and surface mount edge connections for soldering the Breakout Board to your own circuit board.  This board makes it easier to use our UCMs in prototypes or products without the need to solder the fine pitch 200 pin SO-DIMM socket to your board.

You can also solder pin headers to the Breakout Board and use traditional breadboarding techniques to build your prototype.

## Displays

### UD435
