# NETMF Intro

.NET Micro Framework (NETMF) is a subset of the full .NET. Initiated by Microsoft for SPOT watches and then later open sourced. The latest working version Visual Studio working with our NETMF products is VS2013.

GHI Electronics’ TinyCLR OS is the upgrade path to NETMF on all our future products. Learn more about TinyCLR (www.tinyclr.com)

To use NETMF, install these components:
1.	Visual Studio 20013 (community edition is also supported)
2.	NETMF VS2013 extension (we need to move locally)
3.	NETMF 4.3 libraries (move locally)
4.	GHI Electronics NETMF SDK. We recommend the latest (link) but older versions are available below for your convenience.
