G400D is compatible the GHI Electronics’ Universal Compute Modules (UCM). Please consider one of these modules as a drop-in hardware replacement for G400d www.ghi.co/products/usm

We recommend TinyCLR OS as a replacement for NETMF. Learn more about TinyCLR at www.tinyclr.com
To help you evaluate TinyCLR OS, we are providing a preview firmware for G400. First, load the boot loader using SAM-BA tools and then load this firmware using our GHI boot loader (link), and then G400 will run TinyCLR-OS
