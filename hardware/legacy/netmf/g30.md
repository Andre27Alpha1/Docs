# G30

The G30 System on Chip (SoC) is a low-cost chipsets running the .NET Micro Framework. It is programmed using Microsoft's Visual Studio using C# or Visual Basic which allows developers to take advantage of the extensive built-in NETMF libraries and GHI Electronics added extensions.

To use G30 SoC, follow the setup instructions on the NETMF into page (link).

We recommend TinyCLR OS as a replacement for NETMF. Learn more about TinyCLR at www.tinyclr.com
To help you evaluate TinyCLR OS, we are providing a preview firmware for G30. Load this firmware using our boot loader (link) and then G30 will run TinyCLR-OS
