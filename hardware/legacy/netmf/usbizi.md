# USBizi

USBizi was the first single chip .NET Micro Framework (NETMF) on the market. It was available in 100pin and 144pin packages. We are no longer making the chip available but we are making all [binaries available for free](https://www.ghielectronics.com/downloads/NETMF/USBizi/), including for commercial use. 


USBizi is supported with NETMF 4.1 (which VS do we need?)
