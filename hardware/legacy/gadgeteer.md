# Gadgeteer

.NET Gadgeteer that was initiated by Microsoft Research and taken to production by GHI Electronics. Gadgeteer had a great few year run, loved for its plug-and-play mainboard and modules.

To use .NET Gadgeteer, install the latest NETMF software as explained in the NETMF intro page (link). Then Also install the .NET Gadgeteer core (make local). (Is it okay to install this after our SDK?)

The Gadgeteer core source code is available at (make local?)
All design files and driver source code for gadgeteer is available at (link)
The Gadgeteer graphical designer was never made available by Microsoft.
