G400D is compatible the GHI Electronics’ [Universal Compute Modules (UCM)](www.ghi.co/products/usm). Please consider one of these modules as a drop-in hardware replacement for G400d 

We recommend TinyCLR OS as a replacement for NETMF. Learn more about TinyCLR at www.tinyclr.com
To help you evaluate TinyCLR OS, we are providing a preview firmware for G120. First, load the boot loader and then load this firmware, and then G120 will run TinyCLR-OS

* G120 Bootloader 2.1.0 (link)
