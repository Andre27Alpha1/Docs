# .NET Gadgeteer Intro

.NET Gadgeteer that was initiated by Microsoft Research and taken to production by GHI Electronics. Gadgeteer had a great few year run, where it was loved for its plug-and-play mainboard and modules.

As the core of .NET Gadgeteer being .NET Micro Framework (NETMF) and with the lack of further support from Microsoft, for both .NET Gadgeteer and NETMF, these products became legacy.

Microsoft's NETMF website (outdated) http://www.netmf.com/

## Open source

Most of the .NET Gadgeteer ecosystem is open source.
*	[Microsoft’s Gadgeteer core](our fork?)
*	GHI Electronics' [Software sources and Hardware design files]( https://github.com/ghi-electronics/NETMF-Gadgeteer)
*	The Gadgeteer graphical designer was never made available by Microsoft.

## Using .NET Gadgeteer
To use .NET Gadgeteer, install the latest NETMF software as explained [here](/hardware/legacy_products/netmf/intro.html). You will also need to install the .NET [Gadgeteer core, this is on codeplex and being shut down](http://gadgeteer.codeplex.com/downloads/get/1519812). (Is it okay to install this after our SDK?)

> [!Tip]
> You can only use Visual Studio 2013, not a newer edition, unless you are using TinyCLR OS.

> [!Tip]
> This is an old [Gadgeteer for Beginner](https://www.ghielectronics.com/downloads/Gadgeteer/NET_Gadgeteer_for_beginners.pdf) document that might be helpful. (move to new server)

# With TinyCLR OS
All .NET Gadgeteer devices are still useable today, and with the latest technologies, thanks to efforts by GHI Electronics and the community. 

It all started in this video!

This means you can still use all your beloved .NET Gadgeteer gear with [TinyCLR OS]( http://www.tinyclr.com/). The first step is to setup your machine as explained [here](../../../tinyclr/tutorials/intro.html).

You can now install the TinyCLR OS firmware on your mainboard. We have individual pages for each one of the mainboards with instructions on how to firmware update. There is also a dedicated [modules page](modules.html) to show the use of each supported module.
