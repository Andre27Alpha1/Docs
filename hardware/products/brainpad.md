## The Original BrainPad
![Original BrainPad](images/original-brainpad.jpg)

The limited-release original BrainPad was used to iron out the details that helped us in creating the leaner and meaner production BrainPad. The original BrainPad is no longer recommended; however, the latest software is mostly compatible with original BrainPad. Feel free to use the original BrainPad with the latest software to ease into the transition.

# Other Software Options
The TinyCLR OS is the official supported system for the BrainPad. However, there are many [other options](fez.md#other-options) listed on the FEZ hardware page (The BrainPad and the FEZ share the same core).
