G400S and G400D are .NET Micro Framework (NETMF) System on Modules.

# Using the NETMF software
We discourage the use of NETMF software on our products in favor for TinyCLR OS. [Read more](../../legacy_products/netmf/intro.md) about the use of NETMF and TinyCLR OS.

# Using TinyCLR OS
If haven't yet, read about using NETMF devices [with TinyCLR OS](../../legacy_products/netmf/intro.md#with-tinyclr-os)

## Loading Bootloader Version 2
1. Download the [bootloader file](../../loaders/ghi_bootloader.md#g400).
2. Download and install SAM-BA. We tested [SAM-BA.2.12.exe](https://old.ghielectronics.com/downloads/NETMF/SDK/sam-ba.2.12.exe) but we should move to [SAM-BA.2.16 for Windows](http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELSAM-BAIN-SYSTEMPROGRAMMER.aspx)
3. Download and unzip the [update scripts](http://files.ghielectronics.com/downloads/Bootloaders/G400%20Bootloader%20Installer.zip). You will have a folder called `G400 Bootloader Installer`.
4. Rename the bootloader file, downloaded earlier, to bootloader.bin and move it to the `G400 Bootloader Installer` folder.
5. Connect SPI1_MISO pin to ground and reset the board. Wait three seconds and remove the connection between SPI1_MISO and ground. on FEZ Raptor, SPI1_MISO is pin 8 on socket 3.
6. Open up the Device Manager, look under Ports, and find a COM port similar to "Bossa Program Port" or "GPS Detect".
7. In the `G400 Bootloader Installer` folder, run `Flash Bootloader.bat`.
8. When prompted, enter the number of the COM port found under Device Manager. For example: for COM10, enter just 10.
9. You will see "Bootloader Update Complete" when the update is finished. The update will take several minutes.

## Loading the Firmware

> [!Tip]
> First make sure you have bootloader v2 loaded. This needs to be done only once.

To activate bootloader v2, hold the LDR0 signal low while resetting the board.

Download the [G400 firmware](../../../tinyclr/downloads.md#g400) and follow [Loading the Firmware](../../loaders/ghi_bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.

> [!Tip]
> The upload takes several seconds to start. Wait about a minute to start seeing the upload progress.
