# Signal Capture
---
The SignalCapture class monitors a pin and records any changes (high-low or low-high transitions) of the pin into an array. It is a digital waveform recorder. Each array element is the number of microseconds between each signal change.

When calling Read, it blocks other code from executing until it either fills the input buffer or it has captured the number of transitions specified by the count argument. If your signal is shorter than that, the call will never return. Make sure to request only what you plan to capture.

The following sample code captures the signal generated by pressing BTN1 on the FEZ. After pressing the button five times, it should print the times between each transition to the output window. Note that the signal capture may record button bounces, resulting in the program finishing before five button presses.

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Signals;

class Program {
    private static void Main() {
        var capturedSignal = new long[10];
        var pin = new SignalCapture(FEZ.GpioPin.Btn1, GpioPinDriveMode.InputPullUp);
        pin.Read(GpioPinValue.Low, capturedSignal, 0, capturedSignal.Length);

        for (var i = 0; i < capturedSignal.Length; i++) {
            Debug.WriteLine(capturedSignal[i].ToString());
        }
    }
}

```
