# Networking
---
TinyCLR OS Networking support is still under development. It currently supports WiFi through STMicroelectronics SPWF04Sx secure WiFi module. The implementation can be found in the `GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Networking` and `GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Networking.Http` libraries. It provides socket and HTTP APIs that should be familiar to any .NET developer. Take a look at the [.NET docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.socket) for samples.

See the [SPWF04Sx](spwf04sx.md) page for details.
