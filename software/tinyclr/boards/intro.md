Our SCM and UCM products all support TinyCLR OS.  TinyCLR can be ported to other devices, and we provide a ready port for a few popular boards.  For information about some of the third party boards we support, please follow the links below.

> [!Note]
> We do not support, test, or guarantee TinyCLR's operation on devices from other manufactures. We are only sharing the experiences of ourselves and others running TinyCLR on third party boards.

## Firmware Update
The firmware needs to be updated to match the assemblies loaded by Visual Studio. If you see an error message about a checksum error then your project's assemblies version does not match the version loaded on the device.

Each board will have details on how to load its firmware.
