# Roadmap

![Roadmap](images/roadmap-noborder.jpg)

Below is an outline of our goals for a stable and production-ready 1.0 release of TinyCLR OS. Of course, this is subject to change and does not include many smaller improvements and features.

With the latest alpha release, TinyCLR has all of the major features we plan to include in the final 1.0 release. Now we are focusing on bugs fixes and final polish. We plan to have a first preview release candidate in early August and a second to follow later that month. If everything goes well, we are aiming for the final release in September.

While we will continue to support and fix bugs in 1.0, we're not done there! High on our list for 2.0 are several important features like improved networking, in field update, even easier interops, and USB host and client. We hope to get as many of these out as soon as we can, in preview form at least. More details will follow after 1.0. 

Longer term we do plan to investigate support for generics and, once we have that, alignment with .NET Standard.
