# Roadmap

![Roadmap](images/roadmap-noborder.jpg)

Below is an outline of our goals for a stable and production-ready 1.0 release of TinyCLR OS. Of course, this is subject to change and does not include many smaller improvements and features.

## v0.8.0 in February
- A Cortex-M7 build of the core library
- Low-level STMicroelectronics Wi-Fi driver
- FEZ Hydra firmware

## v0.9.0 in March
- A .NET sockets and HTTP library for any interface (including ST's Wi-Fi)
- A .NET IO library for any interface
- Native driver for SPI displays

## v1.0.0 previews in April
We plan to be feature-complete by the first preview release and focus on a lot of final polish, bug fixing, documentation updates, and publishing in the online galleries. There will be at least one preview, but there may be more if required. If all goes well, we're aiming for a final release in early to mid May.

While we will continue to support and fix bugs in 1.0, we're not done there! High on our list for 2.0 are several important features like file system, improved networking, in field update, more graphics, even easier interops, and USB host and client. We hope to get as many of these out as we can, in preview form at least, by the end of 2018. More details will follow after 1.0. 

Longer term we do plan to investigate support for generics and, once we have that, alignment with .NET Standard.
