.NET Micro Framework (NETMF) is a subset of the full Microsoft .NET Framework used to make Windows applications. NETMF was initiated by Microsoft for SPOT watches and then later open sourced. The latest version of Visual Studio working with our NETMF products is VS2013.

> [!Tip]
> We discourage the use of NETMF on our products in favor of [TinyCLR OS](../../software/tinyclr/intro.md). Learn more about using NETMF devices [with TinyCLR OS]().

To start using NETMF go to our [Getting Started page](getting-started.md).

The [NETMF for Beginners](http://files.ghielectronics.com/downloads/NETMF/NETMF_for_Beginners.pdf) guide is is recommended for those who are new to NETMF.
