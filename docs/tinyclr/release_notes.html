<h2 id="080-on-2018-02-01">0.8.0 on 2018-02-01</h2>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>This release adds a firmware and bootloader for the FEZ Hydra, a driver for the SPWF04Sx Wi-Fi module from STMicroelectronics, and a build of the core for Cortex-M7 based devices. We&#39;ve also updated to the latest GCC and CMSIS builds, so be sure to visit the <a href="porting/intro.html">porting</a> page to ensure you have the latest if you build your own firmware.</p>
<p>Also added are overloads to the various SPI and I2C write and read functions that take an offset and a count so you no longer need to pass exact sized buffers. The previous overloads still exist for compatibility  with UWP. While they&#39;re not yet exposed in managed code publicly, UART and CAN now allow you to customize the size of the read and write buffer for each port to suit your needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, we&#39;ve also added <code>GetString</code> to the Encoding class (as before, only UTF8 is provided by default). It takes a byte array so you can create a string without having to use an intermediate char array, potentially wasting space. Additionally, since strings are represented as UTF8 internally, you can save on having your already-UTF8 <code>byte[]</code> converted to UTF16 when it&#39;s converted to <code>char[]</code>, then back to UTF8 when using that <code>char[]</code> to create a string.</p>
<p>To get started with the FEZ Hydra, you&#39;ll need to install the GHI Bootloader. Follow <a href="../hardware/legacy_products/gadgeteer/fez_hydra.html#using-tinyclr-os">these steps</a> to get going.</p>
<p>As before, you can find all downloads in their respective sections on the <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a> page. Just download the new installers and NuGet packages to get going. You don&#39;t even need to download the firmwares since you can use the update firmware feature in TinyCLR Config to automatically download them for you.</p>

<h2 id="070-on-2018-01-04">0.7.0 on 2018-01-04</h2>
<h3 id="notes-1">Notes</h3>
<p>This release adds CAN support to many devices. The managed API reflects the UWP provider model, but there are more changes to come. We&#39;ve also fixed the issue in the latest Visual Studio 15.5 update that prevents projects from building along with many other firmware level bugs. For best results with the 15.5 fix, you should either recreate your projects or remove the <code>NoStdLib</code> and <code>AddAdditionalExplicitAssemblyReferences</code> properties from your csproj (or vbproj).</p>
<p>There have been several changes around the interop API in this release that makes it easier to interact with managed arguments, fields, and objects including reading, writing, creation, and reassignment. You can find an updated basic example on the <a href="porting/native_interops.html">interop docs</a>. There was also a field added to the API info object that allows the API author to track custom state based on their needs.</p>
<p>As before, you can find all downloads in their respective sections on the <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a> page. There are no new bootloader releases this time. Just download the new installers and NuGet packages to get going. You don&#39;t even need to download the firmwares since you can use the update firmware feature in TinyCLR Config to automatically download them for you.</p>

<h2 id="060-on-2017-08-31">0.6.0 on 2017-08-31</h2>
<h3 id="notes-2">Notes</h3>
<p>This release adds support for the G400 and all of our previous NXP based devices: G120, EMX, Embedded Master, and USBizi. There are new LPC17 and LPC24 ports and ARM7, ARM9, and CortexM3 builds of the core now available in the <a href="https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports">GitHub repo</a>. There are new classes available in the <code>Pins</code> library to go along with these new ports. The other major changes in this release are fixed automatic loading of USB drivers, updated bootloaders for devices, continued improvements to the <code>BrainPad</code> library, <code>Acquire</code> and <code>Release</code> were added to all native APIs, native interops have increased functionality, and sharing modes for devices are now supported.</p>
<p>Also available in this release is a very early preview of the new TinyCLR Config tool. It can be used to check your device for updates over the internet and install an update if found (if the device has the GHI Bootloader version 2); save, load, erase, pause, and resume the managed application; and capture debug messages. More functionality is planned. See <a href="tinyclr_config.html">here</a> for more information. Relatedly, we are also making signed drivers for the GHI Bootloader available for Windows 7 and 8. These drivers are not needed on Windows 10 or newer.</p>
<p>Lastly, how we distribute releases is changing going forward. There&#39;s no longer one monolithic archive to download. Instead, everything TinyCLR can be found on its <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a> page and bootloader binaries are available on the bootloader <a href="../hardware/loaders/ghi_bootloader.html#downloads">download</a> page. MD5 hashes are provided for all downloads as well.</p>

<h2 id="050-on-2017-07-07">0.5.0 on 2017-07-07</h2>
<h3 id="notes-3">Notes</h3>
<p>This release focuses on the public porting library and API -- though there are a few minor fixes and changes in other areas. As part of the new porting experience, we are also releasing a very early build of TinyCLR for the Netduino 3 and Quail mainboard!</p>
<p>You can now port TinyCLR OS to run on your own system using the header file and library we provide -- as long as your architecture is supported. Currently, only Cortex M4 is available. Keep in mind the available API is still alpha and may change, especially USB client. See <a href="porting/intro.html">here</a> for details. You can also create your own managed functions that can call into native code that you provide. These will be automatically wired into the system for a seamless experience. See <a href="porting/native_interops.html">here</a> for details.</p>
<p>To support this, we added a few more classes under <code>System.Runtime.InteropServices</code>. Most important is the <code>Interop</code> class. It allows you to add and remove interops from the system by providing it with the address in memory of the interop definition table. It expects you to load it into memory yourself using the <code>Marshal</code> class. You can use <code>FindAll</code> to get back a list of all interops registered in the system and <code>RaiseEvent</code> to trigger an event on the specified native event dispatcher.</p>
<p>The <code>NativeEventDispatcher</code> class allows you to get an instance of the class to receive events that the specified dispatcher name receives (either from native code or <code>Interop.RaiseEvent</code>). It has a single event that gets triggered whenever an event is received. There is only one instance per dispatcher name, so calls to <code>GetDispatcher</code> with the same name will return the same instance.</p>
<p>Similar to <code>Interop</code>, <code>Api</code> can be used to add and remove native APIs from the system. It expects you to load the API into memory yourself and pass it the address of the API definition. You can query all registered APIs, find a specific API by name and type, and parse and creator selectors. Selectors are a string that represents an API name and index into its implementations of the form &quot;name\index&quot;. A default selector is set so that a specific API type can be returned without knowing the exact name, like the default GPIO controller on a system.</p>
<p>The <code>Api</code> class is used internally by the devices library to talk to the native implementation via the implementation <code>IntPtr</code> provided for the given API name and index. In some cases you can use the <code>GetDefault</code> method on a given device provider to return the default registered API. If there is no default, like for PWM and others, you can pass the <code>Id</code> property in the specific pins class to the desired device provider.</p>
<p>We added <code>Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer</code> to enable you to create a quick native interop for a specific address in memory that takes a single <code>ref IntPtr</code> parameter and returns nothing. <code>DeviceInformation</code> was also added to return the device name, manufacturer, and version set on the native side.</p>
<p>After flashing the firmware for the first time on any device, Windows may still use the old NETMF USB IDs preventing the device from being seen by TinyCLR. Uninstall the device from the Device Manager and reinstall it to fix it. To update the firmware on pre-Windows 10 machines, you will need the bootloader drivers provided by our existing <a href="https://old.ghielectronics.com/support/netmf/sdk/41/ghi-electronics-netmf-sdk-2016-r1">2016 R1 NETMF SDK</a>.</p>

<h2 id="040-on-2017-05-10">0.4.0 on 2017-05-10</h2>
<h3 id="notes-4">Notes</h3>
<p>This release primarily fixes several bugs; implements more of the serial API; adds <code>DataReader</code>, <code>DataWriter</code>, and <code>Marshal</code> classes; and reworks a lot of the BrainPad API. A new Storage library was added that moves some large members (like <code>DataReader</code>) out of Devices that you may not always needed. There is more to be added to this library down the road. <code>SignalGenerator</code>, <code>SignalCapture</code>, and <code>PulseFeedback</code> were renamed to match the Windows 10 counterparts. Their API will be updated to match as well in a future release.</p>
<p>The <code>Marshal</code> class under <code>System.Runtime.InteropServices</code> can be used like the old <code>Register</code> and <code>AddressSpace</code> classes to read and write memory. It also adds allocating and releasing unmanaged memory from the managed side that can be manipulated from the other members. </p>
<p>You can see a quick example on using the new serial API <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f26c82e463c397cd716c6fb807111913">here</a>. You must use either the <code>DataReader</code> and <code>DataWriter</code> classes or use the <code>WindowsRuntimeBufferExtensions</code> to manipulate a <code>Buffer</code> since the internal array is no longer publicly accessible to match the UWP API. Pay attention to the <code>Load</code> and <code>Store</code> members. You can&#39;t read before calling <code>Load</code> and writes do not get flushed until you call <code>Store</code>.</p>
<p>There has been no change to the G120 and G400 bootloaders in this release so you do not need to update them if you already have them on your device from the 0.3.0 release.</p>
<p>After flashing the firmware for the first time on any device, Windows may still use the old NETMF USB IDs preventing the device from being seen by TinyCLR. Uninstall the device from the Device Manager and reinstall it to fix it. To update the firmware on pre-Windows 10 machines, you will need the bootloader drivers provided by our existing <a href="https://old.ghielectronics.com/support/netmf/sdk/41/ghi-electronics-netmf-sdk-2016-r1">2016 R1 NETMF SDK</a>.</p>

<h2 id="030-on-2017-04-06">0.3.0 on 2017-04-06</h2>
<h3 id="notes-5">Notes</h3>
<p>This release has several API additions. Some were added as features themselves (software SPI, SignalGenerator, etc) while others were added to support certain features (the VB runtime, string.Format, MemoryStream and IntPtr for Drawing, etc). We&#39;re working to align ourselves with the various <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource">.NET Reference Sources</a> available. You&#39;ll also see many new icons throughout, application templates for the BrainPad, and common item templates. The NuGet packages that have dependencies (such as on Core), now require the major and minor versions to match. For example, the 0.3.0 Devices library depends on Core [0.3.0,0.4.0). This is to further our use of SemVer so that the native interop checksum only changes in major and minor versions. See the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/dependency-versions">NuGet docs</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The biggest addition is the drawing library. It was designed to mirror System.Drawing from the desktop. The basic API is there but there is still more work to be done. To support this, a DisplayController was added to the devices library to configure the display. Since there is no config yet you need to configure the display every time your program starts. A notable change from NETMF is calling flush on a drawing surface the size of the display will no longer draw to the display. Only drawing surfaces created from the FromHdc method passing in the Hdc value from the DisplayController will flush to the display. At this time, only bmp images are supported. Make sure you add a reference to GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Drawing if using bitmap or font resources. Since it&#39;s in NuGet now it isn&#39;t automatically added.</p>
<p>Support for Visual Basic has also been reenabled. One important thing to keep in mind is that there is no longer a Microsoft.VisualBasic assembly. We are using the embedded runtime option provided by Roslyn. It relies on several APIs being present in the core library. We added several of the key APIs needed to enable common usage scenarios. If you find you&#39;re getting cryptic compile errors from locations not in your code, let us know so we can evaluate what additional APIs are required.</p>
<p>Since the UWP API only supports a controller wide frequency, we had to rework PWM a little bit. There is no longer one controller like there is for GPIO, instead one controller exists for each frequency source. On devices like the G30 and G80, this is a timer. On devices like the G400, there are independent registers for each channel (so unfortunately there will be one controller per channel). The pins library has been updated to organize PwmPin around controllers. SignalGenerator, SignalCapture, and PulseFeedback have also been added, but their APIs will change in a future release to match the UWP style. You can also now change what gets returned by GetDefault calls on the various controllers by updating LowLevelDevicesController.DefaultProvider.</p>
<p>The Diagnostics namespace now matches the desktop version more closely. WriteLineIf and Assert were added to Debug and Trace was added as well. All methods on Debug and Trace are marked with the Conditional attribute as expected using the DEBUG and TRACE constants respectively. There&#39;s also now a Listeners property on each. This is a collection that you can add to so you can receive whatever is written to Trace or Debug by registering a class derived from TraceListener. As on the desktop, both Trace and Debug share the same listener collection. By default, the collection is populated with a listener that prints to the debug transport which is now at Debugger.Log. Collect and GetTotalMemory were added to GC. Note that GetTotalMemory returns the amount of memory used, not free, to match the desktop. We&#39;re investigating APIs to return the amount free.</p>
<p>The last notable change is that we implemented IntPtr and UIntPtr. For now, they&#39;re only used as the type of the Hdc property in drawing. We expect them to be used in more places going forward. Since these two types map to native int and native unsigned int in the CLR and the managed compilers emit those types when they encounter IntPtr or UIntPtr, we have also added initial support for those types in the interpreter and runtime as well. Let us know if you encounter any weird or hard to explain runtime issues.</p>
<p>This release also includes the firmware for the G400. It requires an updated bootloader from the one provided on the <a href="https://old.ghielectronics.com/docs/336/g400-bootloader-installation">G400 bootloader installation page</a>. Simply download the bootloader installer from the installation page and replace Bootloader.bin with the bootloader provided in the TinyCLR download package (making sure to rename it to Bootloader.bin). This updated bootloader can still be used to install the NETMF G400 firmware. It will eventually replace the one provided on the installation page.</p>
<p>After flashing the firmware for the first time on any device, Windows may still use the old NETMF USB IDs preventing the device from being seen by TinyCLR. Uninstall the device from the Device Manager and reinstall it to fix it. To update the firmware on pre-Windows 10 machines, you will need the bootloader drivers provided by our existing <a href="https://old.ghielectronics.com/support/netmf/sdk/41/ghi-electronics-netmf-sdk-2016-r1">2016 R1 NETMF SDK</a>.</p>

<h2 id="020-on-2017-03-07">0.2.0 on 2017-03-07</h2>
<h3 id="notes-6">Notes</h3>
<p>You cannot use projects you made for the 0.1.0 version. You must recreate them and re-add your code files because of the changes to the project templates to make them more closely align them with the desktop .NET templates -- you&#39;ll notice the only difference is a few properties which prevent inclusion of reference assemblies. The templates also use the .NET Framework 4.5.2 target framework. This is only for NuGet compatibility going forward and does not mean you can use other libraries targeting that framework. This was done in anticipation of broader project system support of the new PackageReference format currently used in .NET Core which fails with unknown target frameworks.</p>
<p>The MSBuild package is no longer provided or required. The metadata processor tool has moved internally to the extension and is invoked during deployment to the device. This means that pe and pdbx files are no longer redistributed with their assemblies -- they appear in a pe folder under the output directory when you deploy. We have also rewritten how dependencies are detected for deployment. If you notice any weird failures around assembly resolution or deployment, let us know and send us the entire project as-is so we can diagnose it.</p>
<p>The information displayed while deploying to the device has also been improved to show more information about what is going on and what stage the deployment is in. We&#39;ve also reworked incremental deployment so that assemblies are deployed one to a flash sector (if space allows) to enable re-deploying only the assemblies that have changed on a sector by sector basis. This greatly increases deployment speed on devices which a large number of flash sectors allocated to deployment.</p>
<p>This release also includes the firmware for the G120 and G120E. Because the current GHI bootloader on the G120 expects to load TinyBooter, we have provided a second stage bootloader with this preview that you must deploy using the existing GHI bootloader as if you were deploying TinyBooter. Once it is deployed and you restart the device, you&#39;ll notice that it starts our newer <a href="https://old.ghielectronics.com/docs/344/ghi-bootloader">GHI bootloader 2.0</a>. You can then use this second bootloader to deploy the TinyCLR OS firmware. Asserting LDR0 will enter the second bootloader while asserting both LDR0 and LDR1 will enter the original bootloader and allow you to return to NETMF.</p>
<p>After flashing the firmware the first time, Windows may still use the old NETMF USB IDs preventing the device from being seen by TinyCLR. Uninstall the device from the Device Manager and reinstall it to fix it. To update the firmware on pre-Windows 10 machines, you will need the bootloader drivers provided by our existing <a href="https://old.ghielectronics.com/support/netmf/sdk/41/ghi-electronics-netmf-sdk-2016-r1">2016 R1 NETMF SDK</a>.</p>
