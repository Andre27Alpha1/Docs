    "title": "SPI",
    "keywords": "SPI SPI uses three, sometimes four, wires for transferring data. The bus on SPI consists of a single master and one or more slaves. The master will send clock to the slaves over the SCK pin. It will also send date over MOSI pin, while reading incoming data on the MISO pin. The SCK clock is used to determine how fast the data is moved. If you know electronics, this is simply a shift register. The master selects which slave it will swap the data with using the SSEL pin, sometimes called CS. In its simplest terms, the master will swap data between itself and the slave. You cannot write data without reading at the same time. However, a lot of time you need to write data and you do not care about the incoming data. For that, there is a Write method. But keep in mind that the Write method is also reading, and discarding, whatever the slave is sending. Tip Some SPI devices (slaves) can have more than one select-pin, like the VS1053 MP3 decoder chip that uses one select pin for data and other for commands. Both share the 3 data transfer pins (SCK, >MOSI, MISO). Tip SPI needs more wires than other similar buses but it can transfer data very fast. A 50Mhz clock is possible on SPI, that is 50 million bits in one second. Tip Note that a board running TinyCLR OS is always a SPI masters, not slaves. using System; using System.Diagnostics; using System.Threading; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Spi; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins; class Program { static void Main() { var settings = new SpiConnectionSettings(0x1C)// the slave's select pin { Mode = SpiMode.Mode1, ClockFrequency = 4* 1000 * 1000,//4Mhz DataBitLength = 8, }; var device = SpiDevice.FromId(FEZ.SpiBus.Spi1, settings); device.Write(new byte[] { 1, 2 });// write something device.TransferSequential(...)// this is good for reading registers device.TransferFullDuplex(...)// this is the only one that trully represents how SPI works } }"

    "keywords": "Introduction to Visual Basic Visual Basic is a modern .NET programming language. It is as powerful as any of the other programmign languiages but its code is more englich-like, making it a student/teacher favorite. The courses are in the process of being created. Please bear with us. Overview Students will learn how to create projects in Visual Studio along with programming basics. Applications in this lesson will be limited to the BrainPad object, If statements, a While loop and the template functions. Guidelines Prerequisites: None Ages 12 and up PC setup with Visual Studio 2017, TinyCLR OS and Nuget packages installed. Supplies: BrainPad and microUSB cable. Install Visual Studio and Download .vsix file Install Visual Studio Community 2017. Select the Community download. Skip this step if you have Visual Studio 2017 installed. Visual Studio 2017 Download Starting a New Project Connect your BrainPad to your computer using a microUSB cable. Next Open Visual Studio select File>New>Project and under Other Languages select Visual Basic>TinyCLR and choose the BrainPad Application . Change the Location to C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\Desktop\\ then name the project BrainPad_Project. From Visual Studio, select File > New > Project. Creating the BrainPad_Project BrainPad TinyCLR Application. Once created, you'll be presented with a Program.vb tab. The Program.vb file and its contents are shown. This file contains the default code when you first create a project. The lines in green that begin with ' are called comments, and they generally describe what the code does. Take a moment to review them. Let's run the code to see these comments' descriptions come to life. Connect the BrainPad and press the F5 function key or the Start button. Press the Start button to run the Program. Visual Studio will now run the code, a few things will happen and the display will now have the text \"Hello, world!\" . The display shows \"Hello world\" What happened exactly? Our application began by calling the BrainPadSetup() function. This function is called one time, when the application starts, and is generally used to set things up. In this case, it executed the BrainPad.Display.DrawText line to instruct the display to show the text \"Hello, world!\" After BrainPadSetup() was finished, the application called BrainPadLoop() . Code placed inside this function is executed in an infinite loop. This is why the code that turns the LED on and then off again never stops. Exercise Change the text to make the program print your name on the display. Answer Change this line to your name instead of \"Hello World!\" BrainPad.Display.DrawText(0,0,\"YOUR NAME HERE\") The BrainPad Object The world around us is full of objects. Every person, table or circuit board is an object. If we were to ask a person to say \"hello,\" we'd be asking an object to perform a task. The same concept can be applied to code. Like in the previous application we ran, the BrainPad was asked to control the display and light bulb through the BrainPad object. The BrainPad object itself, is a piece of code that is contained in one file. This was developed by GHI Electronics to cover the internals of the BrainPad . This enables students like you, with an easy way to control the BrainPad circuit board. After typing BrainPad , press the period key to get a list of all available options for this object, like Display . Using IntelliSense we can see the options offered by the BrainPad object. Now we can use the arrow keys to go up and down in the list to find the Display , and then press the period key again to see what options are the available for the Display . Using IntelliSense we can see the options offered by the Display object. Visual Studio does a great deal of simplifying programming by automatically listing the available options for each object. Now that we know how to use the BrainPad object, let's learn about controlling the LED Light Bulb. The BrainPad LightBulb LED lights are used in many different electronic devices. Here we will test the LightBulb by turning it GREEN , then ON and OFF . Copy and paste the code from Example 1 into your project's BrainPadSetup() function. BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() Put this code inside the BrainPadSetup() function. Now, press F5 to run the code and you'll see the LightBulb turn GREEN and stay on. This happens because our code is executed faster than we can see. Problem Solving Since applications execute extremely fast, we need to slow them down to figure out the problem. This way we can see what is happening or if the results are as expected. We will start by stepping in code to see what the application does at a slow speed. Stepping in Code Add a breakpoint at the first line of code inside of BrainPadSetup() by moving the cursor to that line and pressing the F9 We've added a breakpoint on line 5. Press F5 to run the application. The project will be built and deployed but then the execution will stop at the breakpoint. The program has executed up to the breakpoint. Press the F10 key to execute the current line, which turns the green light off. Now press the F10 key again, and the LightBulb will turn GREEN . The next steps will continue through the rest of the code. When you reach the closing curly bracket, press F5 to stop. Now that we know our code works (it's just happening too fast) we can add some delays so we can see the light turn on and then off. Delays in Code In order to see what's going on we need to add some delays in the code. This is done by telling the BrainPad to wait between tasks. BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.5) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.5) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.5) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() This code waits half a second (0.5) between turning the Lightbulb GREEN and OFF. Copy and paste the code from above into your project's BrainPadSetup() function. Run the code and observe the LightBulb again. You should now see the LightBulb turning GREEN and off every half a second. Exercise Create a Traffic Light simulation using the following logic and the LightBulb: Turn the light on GREEN Wait 5 seconds. Turn the LightBulb off. Turn the light on YELLOW Wait 2 seconds. Turn the LightBulb off. Turn the light on RED Wait 5 seconds. Answer BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(5) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnYellow() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(5) While Loop The previous exercise turned the LightBulb several colors but it only did it once. We could repeat the code over and over to make the traffic light run a few more times but what if we want this to run indefinitely? This is where While loops come in handy. While BrainPad.Looping 'Your code End While Code inside a while loop will be executed indefinitely. Code inside a while loop will be executed indefinitely as long as its condition is met. In our case, we'll use a constant value from the BrainPad object called Looping . This constant always returns true, which causes the loop's condition to always be met. While BrainPad.Looping BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.5) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.5) End While This code will blink the LightBulb GREEN on and off for half a second indefinitely. Let's keep things simple and blink the LightBulb GREEN every half a second. Copy and paste the code from above into your project's BrainPadSetup() function. Run the code and observe the LightBulb. Tip The BrainPadLoop() function does the same thing as our While loop behind the scenes, so you can use this function in your application to simplify things. Understanding The Loop To further understand what's going on, add a breakpoint by moving the cursor to the first line where we turn the light GREEN and press F9 . This will add a breakpoint and pause the application as soon as it reaches that line. block Add a breakpoint while the application is running Now use F10 to step through the code and when the program reaches the end of the While loop it will go back to the beginning. Stop the program execution by pressing the STOP button. The stop button will stop the application that's running. Now, reset the BrainPad and note how the green light is still blinking but this time without the need for Visual Studio. In fact, you can connect the BrainPad to any appropriate power source (such as a phone charger) and the LightBulb will turn on GREEN and will blink without the need for a PC. Exercise Make the LightBulb cycle through 3 different colors indefinitely. Answer Public Sub BrainPadSetup() While BrainPad.Looping BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.5) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.5) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnYellow() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.5) End While End Sub If Statement An If statement (or conditional statement) checks to see if a statement is TRUE or FALSE and then does one of two things depending on the result. Like if the DOWN button is pressed, turn the LightBulb GREEN . Public Sub BrainPadSetup() BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() If BrainPad.Buttons.IsDownPressed() Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() End If End Sub Pressing and hold the down button when running this program will turn the LightBulb GREEN. For the code above to work, you have to be holding the button down at the time the program is deployed. This is because once the If statement is reached, the program will continue executing until the program ends. To solve this hard to reach goal, we need to repeatedly check if the button is pressed, as seen in the above code. This is where a While loop comes in handy. Let's use the BrainPadLoop() function to simplify things per the tip earlier . Public Sub BrainPadSetup() BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() If BrainPad.Buttons.IsDownPressed() Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() End If End Sub The above code makes sure the LightBulb is OFF and then it falls into an infinite loop. However, this program still has a bug. Run the program and test it. The LightBulb will be OFF when the program runs and then once the down button is pressed the the LightBulb turn GREEN . That is all good so far, but when the button is released, the LightBulb never turns OFF . Can you guess why? Try stepping in the code to see what happens when the button is pressed and when it is not pressed . Computers are strict on following orders. In previous examples, the LightBulb never turned OFF because we actually never told the program to turn the LightBulb OFF . This means we have to tell the program to turn the LightBulb ON when the button is pressed and we also have to tell it to turn the LightBulb OFF when the button is not pressed . Public Sub BrainPadSetup() BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() If BrainPad.Buttons.IsDownPressed() Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() End If If Not BrainPad.Buttons.IsDownPressed() Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() End If End Sub This code loops indefinitely checking if the down button is pressed. If it is pressed, the LightBulb will turn on GREEN The above code first makes sure the LightBulb is off and then it falls into an infinite loop. However, this program still has a bug. Run the program and test it. The LightBulb will be off when the program runs and then once the down button is pressed the the LightBulb turn GREEN . That is all good so far, but when the button is released, the LightBulb never turns off. Can you guess why? Try stepping in the code to see what happens when the button is pressed and when it is not pressed . Computers are strict on following orders. In previous examples, the LightBulb never turned off because we actually never told the program to turn the GREEN LightBulb off. This means we have to tell the program to turn the light on when the button is pressed and we also have to tell it to turn the LightBulb off when the button is not pressed as shown. Public Sub BrainPadSetup() BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() If BrainPad.Buttons.IsDownPressed() Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() End If If Not BrainPad.Buttons.IsDownPressed() Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() End If End Sub This code will turn the LightBulb GREEN when the down button is pressed, and off when the down button **is not pressed** the **LightBulb** will turn on While the BrainPad doesn't have a method called BrainPad.Button.IsDownNotPressed() we can continue to use BrainPad.Button.IsDownPressed() but with If Not before it to represent if the button is not pressed . Now when you run it, not pressing the button will turn/keep the LightBulb off. Exercise Turn the LightBulb GREEN when the up button is pressed . Turn the LightBulb off when the down button is pressed . Turn the LightBulb RED on when the left button is pressed and BLUE when right button is pressed Answer Public Sub BrainPadSetup() BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() If BrainPad.Buttons.IsUpPressed() Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() End If If BrainPad.Buttons.IsDownPressed() Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() End If If BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed() Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed() End If If BrainPad.Buttons.IsRightPressed() Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed() End If End Sub Else Statement The Else statement is always used with the If statement and has a very useful purpose that would be perfect for the last example. Previously, we needed to check if the button is pressed and if the button is not pressed. We can simplify this by catching when an If statement isn't true using Else as shown in the code below. Public Sub BrainPadSetup() BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() If BrainPad.Buttons.IsDownPressed() Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() Else BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() End If End Sub This code uses an else statement to check if a button is pressed or not to turn the LightBulb green and off. Or & And Operators The most used logical operators are the Or and And operators. These are typically used within the If statement. In the example below, we want the buzzer to generate a 5,000 Hz sound when both the up and down buttons are pressed. This is accomplished by using an && operator between IsUpPressed() and IsDownPressed() . Public Sub BrainPadLoop() If BrainPad.Button.IsUpPressed() And BrainPad.Button.IsDownPressed() Then BrainPad.Buzzer.Start(5000) Else BrainPad.Buzzer.Stop() End If End Sub This code checks if both up and down are pressed, if so it plays a high pitch sound. Exercise Turn the LightBulb GREEN on and play the buzzer at 5,000 Hz whenever the up or down button is pressed. Pressing both or either one will have the same effect. Extra Credit Tip: Use nested statements such as an If statement inside another If statement."

You can use the serial option to update the loader. This is a one-time procedure. You should have no issues after the bootloader V2 is loaded. To update using USB Download the EMX bootloader file Set the board's configuration switches in boot mode. That is by setting switches #1, #2 and #3 to the ON position. Connect the FEZ Spider to a power module (red module) and then to a PC. The PC will now detect a virtual serial (COM) device. If you need drivers, they are in the NETMF SDK. Open any terminal software, we recommend Tera Term . Select serial and pick the COM port associated with your board. Enter E and you will see back \"Erase all memory! Are you sure?\" now enter Y . (The bootloader is case sensitive) Enter X and you will see CCCC ... showing on the terminal. Now go to File -> Transfer -> XMODEM -> Send and then check the 1K option. Select the bootloader file you have downloaded above. You will see File Transfer Finished Successfully . Change the configuration switches back to the off position and reset the board. You are now running GHI Electronics bootloader v2! To update using Serial Connect a USB-serial module to socket 11. Follow the exact same steps above except you need to also switch #4 to ON (serial mode) and you need to set the baud rate to 115200 on the terminal software. The drivers for the USB-serial module should load automatically. If not, get them from http://www.ftdichip.com/ Loading the Firmware Tip First make sure you have bootloader v2 loaded. This needs to be done only once. To activate bootloader v2, set the configuration switch #1 to the on position and then reset your board. Make sure to set back to off after loading the firmware. Download the EMX firmware and follow Loading the Firmware steps."

    "keywords": "I2C I2C (pronounced eye-squared-sea, or eye-two-sea) was originally developed by Phillips to allow multiple chipsets to communicate on a 2-wire bus in home consumer devices. It has a master and one or more slaves sharing the same data bus. Instead of selecting the slaves using a digital pin like SPI, which consumes an additional I/O pin, I2C uses an addressing mechanism to communicate to a selected device. Before data is transferred, the master sends out a 7-bit address of the slave device it wants to communicate with. It also sends one bit indicating whether it wants to send data to the slave or receive data from the slave. When a slave sees its address on the bus, it will acknowledge its presence. At this point, the master can send or receive data. The master will start data transfers with a \"start condition\" before it sends any address or data and then end it with \"stop condition\". The two wires used to communicate between the I2C Master and the I2C salves are called SDA and SCL lines; SDA stands for Serial Data, and SCL is Serial Clock. This is a partial demo showing the use of I2C. using System; using System.Diagnostics; using System.Threading; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.I2c; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins; class Program { static void Main() { var settings = new I2cConnectionSettings(0x1C)// the slave's address { BusSpeed = I2cBusSpeed.FastMode }; var device = I2cDevice.FromId(FEZ.I2cBus.I2c1, settings); device.Write(new byte[] { 1, 2 });// write something device.WriteRead(...)// this is good for reading registers } } Software I2C The I2C bus is relatively simple and can be \"bit banged\" using software. The advantage is that any two GPIO pins can be used. However, software I2C requires more system resources and runs slower. This example initializes the software I2C drivers and then, from this point, using I2C is the same as standard hardware I2C. using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.I2c; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins; class Program { static void Main() { var softwareProvider = new I2cSoftwareProvider(FEZ.GpioPin.PA0, FEZ.GpioPin.PA1); var controllers = I2cController.GetControllers(softwareProvider); var controller = controllers[0]; var device = controller.GetDevice(new I2cConnectionSettings(0x22) { BusSpeed = I2cBusSpeed.StandardMode, SharingMode = I2cSharingMode.Exclusive }); } }"

Using .NET Gadgeteer To use the .NET Gadgeteer legacy software, install: Visual Studio 20013 (community edition is also supported) Unzip and install netmfvs2013.vsix and MicroFramewrokSDK.msi from here Microsoft's Gadgeteer Core GHI Electronics' NETMF SDK . The latest is recommended. The Gadgeteer for Beginners guide is a good starting point. Tip You can only use Visual Studio 2013, not a newer edition, unless you are using your Gadgeteer hardware with TinyCLR OS . With TinyCLR OS All .NET Gadgeteer devices are still useable today, and with the latest technologies, thanks to efforts by GHI Electronics and the community. It all started in this video! This means you can still use all your beloved .NET Gadgeteer gear with TinyCLR OS . The first step needed to use TinyCLR OS is to load the GHI Bootloader v2 onto your mainboard, then use that to load the TinyCLR OS firmware. Each mainboard product page includes the needed instructions. Once those are loaded, you can start blinking the debug LED, detailed in the next section. Blinking the LED Tip If you have never used TinyCLR OS before, start here This example will blink the debug LED. You only need to add a power module to your mainboard. using System.Threading; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins; class Program { static void Main() { var led = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(FEZSpider.GpioPin.DebugLed); led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output); while(true) { led.Write(GpioPinValue.High); Thread.Sleep(200); led.Write(GpioPinValue.Low); Thread.Sleep(200); } } } Tip The complete pin mapping is made available through GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins .

    "keywords": "Introduction to C# on the BrainPad It is not a secret that C and C++ are the most popular programming languages among professionals. This is particularly true for programmers that work with small digital systems. C# (pronounced see-sharp) and a modern cousin of the C and C++ family. Its syntax is very close to Java, another very popular programming language. Overview Students will learn how to create projects in Visual Studio along with programming logic. Applications in this lesson will be limited to the BrainPad object, If statements, a While loop and the template methods. Install Visual Studio and TinyCLR OS extension Skip this step if you have Visual Studio 2017 and the TinyCLR OS extension installed: Setting Up Visual Studio for the BrainPad Guidelines Prerequisites: None Ages 6 and up PC setup with Visual Studio 2017 and TinyCLR OS extension installed. Click Here Supplies: BrainPad and microUSB cable. Starting a New C# BrainPad Project Next Open Visual Studio select File > New > Project and under Other Languages select Visual C# > TinyCLR and choose the BrainPad Application . Change the Location to C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\Desktop\\ then name the project BrainPad_Project . From Visual Studio, select File > New > Project: Once created, you'll be presented with a Program.cs tab. This file contains the default code when you first create a project. The lines in green that begin with // are called comments, and they generally describe what the code does. Take a moment to review them. You can create your own comments in the code by typing // before any notes you like to add. Comments don't affect how your program runs. Comments are a great place to keep notes about how a piece of code might work. They are helpful if another programmer looks at your code, or you return to look at your own code at a later date, to help you understand what the code is doing behind the scenes. Let's run the code to see these comments' descriptions come to life. Connect the BrainPad and press the F5 function key or the Start button. Visual Studio will now run the code, a few things will happen and the display will now have the text \"Hello!\" . The BrainPad Object The world around us is full of objects. Every person, table or circuit board is an object. If we were to ask a person to say \"hello,\" we'd be asking an object to perform a task. The same concept can be applied to code, specifically object-oriented programming. Like in the previous application we ran, the BrainPad was asked to control the Display through the BrainPad object. The BrainPad object itself, is a piece of code that is contained in one file. This was developed by GHI Electronics to cover the internals of the BrainPad. This enables students like you, with an easy way to control the BrainPad circuit board. After typing BrainPad , press the period key to get a list of all available options for this object, like LightBulb. As shown in the image below. Now we can use the arrow keys to go up and down in the list to find the LightBulb, and then press the period key again to see what options are the available for the LightBulb. Visual Studio does a great deal of simplifying the programming process by automatically listing available options for an object. They call this neat option built into Visual Studio, IntelliSense Now that we know how to use the BrainPad object, let's learn about controlling the LightBulb . The BrainPad LightBulb LED lights are used in many different electronic devices. Here we will test the LightBulb by turning it green, then on, then off. Copy and paste the code from the example below into your project's BrainPadSetup() , between its two curly braces { } . You'll also notice every line of code must ends with a semicolon ; Tip Parentheses ( ) and curly braces { } are used differently in C# programming, do not confuse them? BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); Now, press F5 on the keyboard or the Start button in Visual Studio to run the code and you'll see the LightBulb turn green come on and stay on. This happens because our code is executed faster than we can see. So we never see the LightBulb actually blink. Problem Solving Since applications execute extremely fast, we need to slow them down to figure out the problem. This way we can see what is happening or if the results are as expected. We will start by running the code one line at a time, this is called stepping in code to see what the application does at a slow speed. Stepping in Code With Visual Studio we can \"step\" through the code executing each line separately one at a time. This will help when you're trying to debug a problem. To do this we need to add what is called a breakpoint or (stop point). A breakpoint is a spot in your program where the code will execute up until it reaches the breakpoint then wait for futher instructions. To add a breakpoint at the first line of code inside of BrainPadSetup() moving the cursor to that line and pressing the F9 key as shown below. A red circle will appear to the left of your code. This is where your code will stop and wait. You can also click in the grey area where the breakpoints appear to either remove or create new breakpoints. Your program can have as many breakpoints as you feel necessary to diagnose any programming issues. Press F5 key or Start button in Visual Studio to run the application. The project will be built and deployed but then the execution will stop at the breakpoint as shown below. Once a program reaches a breakpoint it pauses the program, right where it is in the code, as noted by the yellow arrow now in the red circle. You have several options to continue or step through you code line by line, while the program is still running. If you press the Continue button in the top tool bar of Visual Studio as shown below. Your program will continue, to the end of the code or the next breakpoint. To the right of the Continue button are more buttons for navigating the code while the program is running. Unlike the Continue button The Step Into button or F11 key advances your program one line of code at a time. This can be very useful when trying to diagnose programming errors. Adding Delays to Code In order to see what's going on we need to add some delays in the program code. This is done by telling the BrainPad to Wait between tasks. Copy and paste the code from below into your project's BrainPadSetup() , between the two curly braces { } . BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); Run the code by pressing F5 key or Start button in Visual Studo and observe the LightBulb again. You should now see it turn green, then on and off twice. Change the LightBulb Color This works great if you only want the LightBulb green. But what if you want a different color? The LED inside the LightBulb is capable of showing more colors than just green. LED TV's use many tiny LEDS lined up in rows and columns to make up the picture you see. Like the LED lights in a TV they are capable of showing many different colors inside just one LED. First let's use code similar to the last example, only this time will change the LightBulb from green to red to blue, using built-in methods already created. Copy and paste the code from below into your project's BrainPadSetup() , between the two curly braces { } . BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnBlue(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); Even more LightBulb Colors. Under the BrainPad.LightBulb object you'll find the method BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor() . The TurnColor(r,g,b) method takes three arguments which describe the color of the light bulb. The first argument tells the light bulb how much red to use, the second how much green, and the third how much blue. Each number is a percentage, or a number from 0 to 100 with 0 being off and 100 being full brightness. BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(100, 100, 100); We'll now redo the code above that turns the light from Green to Red to Blue. But this time we'll use the TurnColor() method to achieve the exact same results. Copy and paste the code from below into your project's BrainPadSetup() , between the two curly braces { } . BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(45, 0, \"Red\"); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(1, 0, 0); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2); BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(35, 8, \"Green\"); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(0, 2, 0); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2); BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(40, 16, \"Blue\"); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(0, 0, 5); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2); BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(29, 24, \"Yellow\"); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(10, 10, 0); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2); BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(41, 32, \"Cyan\"); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(0, 20, 20); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2); BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(25, 40, \"Magenta\"); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(50, 0, 50); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2); BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(37, 48, \"White\"); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(100, 100, 100); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2); BrainPad Buzzer Included on your BrainPad is a Buzzer. You can use this Buzzer to program different sounds you�d like to use in your program. Like the BrainPad.LightBulb object, you�ll also have to tell the Buzzer object to Beep , StartBuzzing and StopBuzzing . Will also tell the BrainPad to Wait in between playing and not playing as sound. When you tell the BrainPad to Wait , the sound will play for that duration. Copy and paste the following code into your BrainPadSetUp() between the curly braces {} . Press F5 key or Start button in Visual Studio. BrainPad.Buzzer.StartBuzzing(100); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); BrainPad.Buzzer.StopBuzzing(); You should hear a very low tone, that plays for one(1) second and stops. Inside the BrainPad.Buzzer.StartBuzzing(100) method you�ll see that in the code we�ve added the value of 100. This is the frequency of the sound that will be played by the Buzzer. You can change this value to create a bunch of different sounds. Let�s try changing it. Copy and paste the following code into your BrainPadSetUp() between the curly braces {} . Press F5 or Start BrainPad.Buzzer.StartBuzzing(400); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); BrainPad.Buzzer.StartBuzzing(100); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); BrainPad.Buzzer.StopBuzzing(); First you�ll hear the Buzzer make a very high sound, then a very low sound. This is what changing the frequency does to the Buzzer. Try changing the frequency to different values and see what kind of sounds the Buzzer makes. BrainPad Buttons The BrainPad comes with four buttons (Up, Down, Left & Right) that can be programmed to do different things. Such as when a button is pressed the LightBulb turns on or the Buzzer makes a sound. To accomplish this we need to use what is called an \"if statement\" An \"if statement\" will check and see if our buttons are being pressed and then execute a piece of code when they are. If Statement if (condition) { Execute this code; } else { Execute this code; } An if statement (or conditional statement) checks to see if a statement is true or false and then does one of two things depending on the result. The example above shows the framework of the if statement. You'll also notice that the if statement is one of the few lines of code that DOES NOT require a semicolon ; at the end of the line. Although the code within the if statement still require an ending semicolon ; Now we'll use the same structure in our code to detect the LEFT button being pressed. public void BrainPadSetup() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed()) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); } } public void BrainPadLoop() { } For the above code to work properly, you have to be holding the button down at the time the program starts. This is because the code within the BrainPadSetup() method only executes once. When the program is first started. Holding down the Left button when the program starts is impractical and not very useful to a program. We need to be able to press & read the button anytime the program is running. To do this we will move the button checking \"if statement\" inside the BrainPadLoop() method instead of the BrainPadSetup() public void BrainPadSetup() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } public void BrainPadLoop() { if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed()) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); } } The above code, first makes sure the Light Bulb is OFF and then it falls into an infinite loop, the BrainpadLoop() . However, this program still has an operational bug. Run the program and test it. The green light will be off when the program runs and then once the LEFT button is pressed the green light will turn on. That is all good so far, but when the button is released, the green light stays on. Can you guess why? Try stepping in the code to see what happens when the button is pressed and when it is not pressed. Computers are strict at following orders. In the previous examples, the Light Bulb never turned off because we actually never told the program to turn the green light off. This means we have to tell the program to turn the light on when the button is pressed and we also have to tell it to turn the light off when the button is not pressed public void BrainPadSetup() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } public void BrainPadLoop() { if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed()) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); } if (!BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed()) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } } The ! symbol represents the opposite. While the BrainPad doesn�t have a method called BrainPad.Button.IsLeftNotPressed() we can continue to use BrainPad.Button.IsLeftPressed() but with a ! before it to represent if the button is not pressed. Now when you run it, not pressing the button will turn/keep the LightBulb off. Logical Operators -- Or & And -- || and && The Or operator is found by holding the shift key and pressing the || key twice, the And operator can be found by holding the shift key and pressing && twice These are typically used within the if statement . Let�s assume in our previous example you wanted to press the Left button to make the LightBulb Green and when you press the Right button you want to make the LightBulb Red. If neither button is pressed the LightBulb is off. To accomplish this you�ll need to use the And operator && to check and make sure both buttons are Not (!) pressed, and turn off the LightBulb . In the code example below, in our third if statement , you can see where we ask the question, �Is the Right button pressed And is the Left button pressed?� Both of these condition must be met in order to execute the code in its curly braces { } . When using the Or operator || , only one of the conditions need to be met to run the code within the curly braces {} . public void BrainPadSetup() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } public void BrainPadLoop() { if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed()) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); } if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsRightPressed()) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed(); } if (!BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed() && !BrainPad.Buttons.IsRightPressed()) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } } The Else Statement The else statement is always used with the if statement and has a very useful purpose that would be perfect for the last example. In previous code example, we needed to check if the Left button was pressed or not. We can simplify this by catching when an if statement isn�t true using else as shown in the code below. public void BrainPadSetup() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } public void BrainPadLoop() { if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed()) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); // If TRUE } else { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); // Else FALSE } } The Else-If Statement The else-if statement closely resembles the else statement but works like both an if statement and an else statement together. Unlike the else statement by itself, the else-if statement checks to make sure its condition is true before executing the code inside it's curly braces {} rather then just executing it by default. An example of the similar code as earlier but using an \"else-if statement\" instead. public void BrainPadSetup() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } public void BrainPadLoop() { if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed()) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); } else if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsRightPressed()) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed(); } else { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } } Whitespace Spaces and lines are used to make our code more readable to humans. C# programs completely ignore whitespace as shown in the code example below. It will execute correctly, but without whitespaces it can be very difficult to read and debug. public void BrainPadSetup(){BrainPad.TrafficLight.TurnGreenLightOff();}public void BrainPadLoop(){if (BrainPad.Button.IsUpPressed() && BrainPad.Button.IsDownPressed()){BrainPad.Buzzer.PlayFrequency(5000);}else{BrainPad.Buzzer.Stop();}}"

A Method Call is nothing more then when the method is used or called in your program. Arguments are values passed into these methods. The following examples list the different ways arguments can be used inside a method call. BrainPad.Buzzer.StartBuzzing(3000); The above example is used to play a sound on the Buzzer. We pass the argument 3000 to the BrainPad.Buzzer.StartBuzzing() method call. The 3000 represents the frequency to play. BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.5); The above example is a method that makes the BrainPad wait 0.5 seconds before executing the next line of code. The 0.5 is the argument. BrainPad.Wait.Seconds() is called the method call the argument goes inside the method call between the parenthesis () of the method. The Integer Variable A variable is a location in memory that is reserved for us to use. Instead having to know where the memory is, the system gives us access to that memory using a name we choose as shown in the example below The type tells the system how much memory to reserve for that one variable. The most widely used variable is an Integer , defined by the int before the variable name, which is 4 bytes and can hold large numbers and negative numbers. For now, we suggest using Integers for everything, except when fractions are needed (more on that later). int count; The above line instructs the system to reserve a variable as an that is named count and the variable type is an Integer, or int when coding. A variable name can use any letters and numbers but it cannot start with a number or contain spaces. Using the underscore symbol is allowed. Valid variable names: int count123; int count_me_in; int count2var; In-valid variables names: int count me; int count#; int 2count; Variables in small programs can use any names. It could even be just �x�. However, using a meaningful name is very important when writing programs, as there maybe hundreds of variables in a large program. One of the benefits of variables, is they can be used to store numbers as shown in the example below. int count; count = 10; � count = 123; In the above example, the count variable is stored with the a value of 10. Later in the code, the same varible is used to store a new number, 123. Varibles can also be used in equation as shown below int count = 5; int result; result = 5 + count; In the above example, we create two variables one named count , which is initilazed with the value of 10, and one named result which is empty. The last line of code, takes the count variable and adds 5 then stores the total in the variable we created named result You can also use the same variable in an equation to increment that variable. Like in the code below. count = count + 1; The code example above takes the current value of count adds 1 to it then stores the result back into the same count variable. This is handy when incrementing a number like the score in a game or counting the number of times something happens in a program. Tip You can shorten the above code to just count++; It means the same as count = count + 1; Using Variables to Change Buzzer Tones In the example below, we create two variables and use them to change the tone of the buzzer, each time a certian button is pressed. public class Program { int frequency; int increment; public void BrainPadSetup() { frequency = 0; increment = 0; } public void BrainPadLoop() { if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsUpPressed()) { increment = 100; } if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsDownPressed()) { increment = -100; } if (increment != 0) { frequency = frequency + increment; increment = 0; BrainPad.Buzzer.StartBuzzing(frequency); BrainPad.WriteToComputer(frequency); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2); BrainPad.Buzzer.StopBuzzing(); } } } As we use the up and down buttons to change the frequency, the value held by the frequency variable is printed in the Output Window. Using the code above, can we determine the highest frequency a person can hear? The if-statement with Variables The same way the if statement was used to check if a button was pressed, it can be used with variables. In the code below we show that if the frequency is larger than 6,000 turn the red light on, otherwise turn it off. Add the code shown below to the BrainPadLoop() in the example above, right above the BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2) line. if (frequency > 6000) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed(); } else { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } Pressing the up button will increase the frequency. Once the frequency is greater than 6,000 the red light will turn on. Inspecting Variables Printing the variable value worked well for small programs with a single variable. It is not practical to continuously print every variable out when it comes to larger programs. Instead, we can use the debugger feature to pause the code and inspect variables. public class Program { int count; public void BrainPadSetup() { count = 0; } public void BrainPadLoop() { count = count + 1; BrainPad.WriteToComputer(count); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2); } } Add a breakpoint to the loop as shown below, then Press F5 key or Start button to start your program and step through the code. Move the mouse over the count variable in your code and wait a second. A pop up window will come up showing the value of the count variable as pictured below. If you press the Continue button the code will continue until the end of the code or it reaches another breakpoint. Since our code is in the BrainPadLoop it will circle around and stop at the same breakpoint, only this time the count variable will be incremented by one. Double Variable While an Integer can hold large numbers, it can't hold fractions. For example, there is no way to set an integer to 0.5 or 123.8. The variable type double should be used whenever fractions are needed. If a double can hold large numbers and fractions, why not just use it for everything? You certainly can but double type variables require more memory and processing. Fractions are not always desirable in the programming world as shown below. public class Program { double frequency; int increment; public void BrainPadSetup() { frequency = 0; increment = 0; } public void BrainPadLoop() { if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsUpPressed()) { increment = 100; } if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsDownPressed()) { increment = -100; } if (increment != 0) { frequency = frequency + increment; increment = 0; BrainPad.Buzzer.StartBuzzing((int)frequency); BrainPad.WriteToComputer(frequency); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2); BrainPad.Buzzer.StopBuzzing(); } } } The code above shows how a double isn't always the best variable type choice. Instead of simply passing an integer into StartBuzzing method we have to cast it as an integer first. This is done by placing (int) before the variable, which requires additional un-needed processing. Time to go back to our favorite green light! In the code below, we will turn the green light on and off for a specified amount of time, set by a variable called delay. The up and down buttons control the delay variable, causing the light to be on and off longer or shorter. The variable is also printed out using WriteToComputer() method with our delay variable as its argument. public class Program { double delay; public void BrainPadSetup() { delay = 0.20; } public void BrainPadLoop() { if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsUpPressed()) { delay = delay + 0.10; } if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsDownPressed()) { delay = delay - 0.10; if (delay < 0) delay = 0; } BrainPad.WriteToComputer(delay); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(delay); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(delay); } } Returned Values Some methods return a value, like when reading the light sensor. This value can be placed into a variable and this variable can be used with if statements. We have lightbulb and light sensor on the BrainPad. Let's turn the light on when it's dark as shown in Example 15. public class Program { double level; public void BrainPadSetup() { level = 0; } public void BrainPadLoop() { level = BrainPad.LightSensor.ReadLightLevel(); BrainPad.WriteToComputer(level); if (level < 0.5) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnWhite(); } else { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } } } How can we determine what threshold to use to turn the lightbulb on? This is a perfect example of when inspecting variables is needed. Run the program and test it by placing a finger over the light sensor to block the light. You may need to adjust the threshold from 0.5 to something else. Take a look at the Output Window to see the light levels to determine what value works best for you. Strings A string is a type of variable that holds text as shown in the code example below. The text \"Hello World!\" is considered a string variable. String variables are always surrounded by quotation marks \"\" . BrainPad.WriteToComputer(\"Hello World!\"); It's important to remember that the value 2 and the string \"2\" are not the same thing. They may be the same to us but internally in the system they are very different. When x is an integer adding 2 + 2 means x equals 4, as you would expect. x = 2 + 2; Let�s assume str is a string variable in the example below, what is the value of str? str = \"2\" + \"2\"; The plus sign symbol + means something different when dealing with strings. Using the plus sign + to connect strings is called concatenation . Which means a series of interconnected things. When concatenating strings in the example above, the result is \"22\". This will make more sense if you try the code below. str = \"Hello number \" + \"2\"; The result is \"Hello number 2\" . Note how even a space makes a difference with in the string. ToString() One of the important built-in methods for variables is the ToString() method. This method will take the value from count and convert it to a string as shown in the code below. public class Program { double count; public void BrainPadSetup() { count = 0; } public void BrainPadLoop() { count = count + 1; BrainPad.WriteToComputer(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()); } } The code above continiously increase the count variable and display it as a string. The variable count an integer that starts at zero and increments by one in every loop. The string \"Count: \" is concatenated before the value to give us these results. It then prints the variable�s value in the Output Window, as seen in the image below. Tip BrainPad.WriteToComputer() method is an excellent way to send messages to Visual Studio about things happening in your program while you're debugging. Messages here are only shown in Visual Studio's Output window and don't effect what's displayed on your BrainPad. C# is smart when it comes to concatenation. Try changing code count.ToString() to just count . Concatenating numbers and other objects with strings will automatically call the ToString() method as shown below. BrainPad.WriteToComputer(\"Count: \" + count); While loops A while loop statement in C# repeatedly executes the code within its curly braces {} as long as a given condition is true. The example below shows the structure of the while loop. while(as long as this condition is true){ This code is executed } You can make a while loop run forever by making it's condition always return true. As shown in the example below. 1 equals 1 is always true. public class Program { public void BrainPadSetup() { int count = 0; while (1 == 1) { count = count + 1; BrainPad.WriteToComputer(\"Count: \" + count); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2); } } public void BrainPadLoop() { //Put your program code here. It runs repeatedly after the BrainPad starts up. } } It should be noted clearly that we used == and not = in the while statement. The single = is used to set a value, not compare them. The code below sets count to the value of 10. int count = 10; While this code below compares count to the value of 10 to see if it's equal. if (count == 10) The Boolean type true can also be used as shown in the example below. public class Program { public void BrainPadSetup() { int count = 0; while (true) { count = count + 1; BrainPad.WriteToComputer(\"Count: \" + count); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2); } } public void BrainPadLoop() { //Put your program code here. It runs repeatedly after the BrainPad starts up. } } Finite while loops Both of the examples above create while loops that never end. So any code below the infinte while loop will never execute. Sometimes we might want to loop until a condition reaches a certain point or value. The code example demonstrates the use of a finite while loop, meaning it will stop looping at some point. public class Program { public void BrainPadSetup() { int count = 0; while (count < 10) { count = count + 1; BrainPad.WriteToComputer(\"Count: \" + count); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2); } } public void BrainPadLoop() { //Put your program code here. It runs repeatedly after the BrainPad starts up. } } The above code counts up to 10 before the while loop stops. However, the count started at zero, and not one. Why didn't it show the zero? If we look at the code above carefully you'll notice that the first line of code in our while loop increase the count variable by one. This happens before it is displayed to the Output window. So by the time we reach the line BrainPad.WriteToComputer(\"Count: \" + count); the count variable is already equal to 1 . To fix this we can move the line: count = count + 1 To the bottom of the while loop. This means the entire contents of the while loop will execute before the count variable is incremented by 1 There is another possible issue in our code. If we want it to count to 10. The program never prints the value 10 to the Output window. In plain English, our program says: run the following code as long as count is less than 10. Since 10 is not less than 10, then 10 will not be printed. The while loop can be easily modified so 10 is printed too. The code example below checks if count is less than or equal to 10. while (count <= 10) Nesting Any reasonably sized program will have loops inside loops, or if statements inside loops, maybe even inside other if statements and loops! This is called nesting. While programmers should try to keep this simple to understand, nesting is sometimes required. How do we write a program that prints one to 10 repeatedly forever? This is accomplished by having two nested while loops. One that counts one to 10, which goes inside another loop that loops indefinitely as shown in code example below. public class Program { public void BrainPadSetup() { int count = 0; while (true) { while (count <= 10) { BrainPad.WriteToComputer(\"Count: \" + count); count = count + 1; BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2); } } } public void BrainPadLoop() { // Declared but not used } } The above program still will not work the way we want. It will print 1 to 10 only once. Then the program will continue to loop but will not print anything after count is greater then 10. Can you fix the code without looking at the solution below? public class Program { public void BrainPadSetup() { int count; while (true) { count = 0; while (count <= 10) { BrainPad.WriteToComputer(\"Count: \" + count); count = count + 1; BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2); } } } public void BrainPadLoop() { // Declared but not used } } Instead of intializing the count variable to 0 at the beginning of our code, we do it inside while loop instead. This means after the nested while loop finishs counting to 10, the first while loop goes back to the top and resets our count variable to 0. Which is less than 10, starting our nested while loop to begin printing again."

Guidelines Prerequisites: None Ages 12 and up PC setup with Visual Studio 2017, TinyCLR OS and Nuget packages installed. Supplies: BrainPad and Micro USB cable. Arguments Arguments are values passed on to methods. For example, to set the frequency of the buzzer, a value is passed on to that method. The 3000 is the arguments. BrainPad.Buzzer.Start(3000) Arguments are also used when adding delays. Here, the 0.2 is the argument. BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2) Variables can be constants, like the numbers used above. They can also be variables, which will be explained in the coming sections. Also, arguments can also be something completely different! Class Program Public Sub BrainPadSetup() 'Declared but not used End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() If BrainPad.Buttons.IsPressed(BrainPad.Buttons.Button.Up) Then BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Up button is pressed\") Else BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Up button is not pressed\") End If End Sub End Class What is that argument used with Button.IsPressed() ? In this case, the Button.IsPressed takes an argument to specify which button is to be checked. This code BrainPad.Buttons.IsPressed(BrainPad.Buttons.Button.Up) Is much clearer than: BrainPad.Button.IsPressed(4) What is button 4? In fact, internally the up button may be number 4 but remembering this will be difficult. Exercise Try to use the wrong argument type then build the project to observe the error messages. Integer Variables Variable is a location in memory that is reserved for us to use. Instead of knowing where the memory is and how it is located, the system gives us an access to that memory using a name we select. Dim count As Integer The above line instructs the system to reserve (Dim) a variable that is named count and the variable type is an Integer. The name can be use any letters from the alphabet and any numbers but it must not start with a number and it can�t contain spaces. Here are few allowed name examples: Dim count123 As Integer Dim countMeIn As Integer Dim count2var As Integer Variables in small programs can use simply names. It can simply be just x . However, using a meaningful name is very important when writing any serious program, as there maybe tens, or hundreds, of variables. The variable now can store numbers. Note that the variable can be used in the equation and in the result as well. count = count + 2 The above code will add 2 to the count. Math can be used as well. count = 5 + result After selecting an appropriate name, an appropriate type is needed. The type tell the system how much memory to reserve for that one variable. The most widely used variable is an Integer, and can hold very large numbers, even negative numbers. We suggest the use for Integers for everything, except when fractions are needed. More on fractions later. Changing Tones Use the code below: Class Program Dim frequency As Integer Dim increment As Integer Public Sub BrainPadSetup() frequency = 0 increment = 0 End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() If BrainPad.Button.IsUpPressed() Then increment = 100 End If If BrainPad.Button.IsDownPressed() Then increment = -100 End If If increment <> 0 Then frequency = frequency + increment increment = 0 BrainPad.Buzzer.Start(frequency) BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(frequency.ToString()) BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2) BrainPad.Buzzer.Stop() End If End Sub End Class The previous example loops 5 times every second and sets the buzzer to a frequency. The frequency is a variable, also named frequency in this example. The buttons will be checked and when the up button is pressed the frequency is incremented by 100 and when the down button is pressed the frequency is decremented by 100. The value held by the frequency variable is also printed using the Debug.Print statement. Can we now determine the highest frequency a person can hear? The if-statement with Variables The same way the if-statement was used to check if a button was pressed, it can be used with variables. If frequency is larger than 6000 then turn the red light off, else turn the red light off. Add this code inside the while-loop in the previous code example. If frequency > 6000 Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed() Else BrainPad. LightBulb.TurnOff() End If Exercise Add a variable that starts at 0 and then it is incremented by 1 in every loop. Once the variable reaches 1000, turn the LightBulb yellow. Print the variable value on the output window and make sure its incrementing, then verify the LightBulb turns yellow when the variable go over 1000. Inspecting Variables Printing the variable value worked well for small programs with a single variable. It is not practical to continuously print every variable out. Instead, we can use the debugger feature to pause the code and inspect variables. Class Program Dim count As Integer = 0 Dim increment As Integer = 0 Public Sub BrainPadSetup() End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() count = count + 1 BrainPad.DebugPrint(count) BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2) End Sub End Class Add a breakpoint in the loop in the previous program and step through code. Move the mouse over the count variable and wait a second. A pop up window will come up showing the value of the count variable. The watch windows can be used with important variables that need to be inspected regularly. Locate the watch window and type the variable name in the left sell. This will show the variable value and type. Exercise Run the previous program for few loops, then pause the program, or add a breakpoint. Inspect the value on the watch window. It should be something other than 0. Change the value manually to 0 and then re-run the program and observe how the output window now shows the variable going back counting from 0. Double Variable While an Integer can hold very large numbers, it can�t hold fractions. For example, there is no way to set an integer to 0.5 or 123.8. The variable type Double should be used whenever fractions are needed. Why not use a Double variable since it can hold large numbers and fractions? You can, but it requires more memory and processing so it isn't as efficient. Class Program Dim frequency As Double Dim increment As Integer Public Sub BrainPadSetup() frequency = 0 increment = 0 End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() If BrainPad.Button.IsUpPressed() Then increment = 100 End If If BrainPad.Button.IsDownPressed() Then increment = -100 End If If increment <> 0 Then frequency = frequency + increment increment = 0 BrainPad.Buzzer.Start(CType(frequency, Integer)) BrainPad.WriteMessageOnComputer(frequency) BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2) BrainPad.Buzzer.Stop() End If End Sub End Class The previous example uses a Double instead of an Integer for the frequency. Since the Buzzer.Start() method expects an integer, the variable need to be converted using the CType(). This is demonstrating how using Double for everything is not desirable. Time to go back and have fun with our favorite green light! This example will turn the green light on for a specific time, set by a variable called delay. It then turns the light off for the same length of time. Pressing the up and down buttons control the delay variable, causing the light to be on and off for longer or shorter periods. The variable is also printed out using DebugOutput() . Class Program Dim delay As Double Public Sub BrainPadSetup() delay = 0.2 End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() If BrainPad.Buttons.IsPressed(BrainPad.Buttons.Button.Up) Then delay = delay + 0.2 End If If BrainPad.Buttons.IsPressed(BrainPad.Buttons.Button.Down) Then delay = delay - 0.2 End If BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(delay) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(delay) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(delay) End Sub End Class Returned Values Some methods return a value, like when reading the light sensor. This value can be placed into a variable and then the variable can be used with if-statements. We have lights bulb and a light sensor on the BrainPad. Why not turn the light on when it is dark? This can be tested by turning the lights off inside the room or by placing a finger over the light sensor to block the light. Class Program Dim level As Double Public Sub BrainPadSetup() level = 0 End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() level = BrainPad.LightSensor.ReadLightLevel() BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(level) If level > 0.5 Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOn() Else BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() End If End Sub End Class How do we know what value to use as the threshold on when to turn the light bulb on? This is a perfect example on where inspecting variables is needed. Run the program and test by placing a finger over the light sensor to block the light. This may not work nicely and you need to adjust the threshold from 0.5 to something else. Take a look at the output window to see the light levels to determine what value work best for your needs. Then stop the program, change the threshold and then run the program again to test the results. Exercise Modify the last program to have a way to set the threshold using the up button. Hint, the threshold was a constant before but now it is going to be a variable that is set to whatever the light sensor returns when the button is pressed. Name the variable threshold and make sure it is type Double. Strings A string is a type of variable that holds text. BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Hello World!\") It is important to remember that the integer 2 and the string \"2\" are not the same thing. This maybe the same for us but internally in the system they are very different. Assuming x is an Integer, what value is in variable x? x = 2 + 2 The result is what you expect, 4. But now assume str is a string variable, what is the value of str? str = \"2\" + \"2\" The string is just text, not a number. When adding strings, the result is a string that combines the strings. The result from above is \"22\". This should make more sense if you try this example. str = \"Hello number \" + \"2\" The result is \"Hello number 2\". Note how even a space makes a difference in the last example. This code will generate an error since 2 is a number here not a string. str = \"Hello number \" + 2 ToString() One of the important built in method for variables is the ToString() method. This method will take the value from the variable and converts it into a string. Class Program Dim count As Integer=0 Public Sub BrainPadSetup() count = 0 End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() count = count + 1 BrainPad.DebugOutput(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()) End Sub End Class The prior example uses a variable type integer that starts at zero and increments by one in every loop. It will then print the variable value in the Output Window. Exercise Show something like this in the output window: Finite while-loops The While loop and BrainPadLoop() have been used extensively so far. The While loop will run while something is true and since we have passed it the value True then it will loop forever. Is this statement true? 1 = 1 Yes 1 equals 1, that is true! So keeping that in mind, we can make a while-loop keep looping forever using this statement. Class Program Public Sub BrainPadSetup() Dim count As Integer count = 0 While 1 = 1 count = count + 1 BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()) End While End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() End Sub End Class Or True can simply be used. Class Program Public Sub BrainPadSetup() Dim count As Integer count = 0 While True count = count + 1 BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()) End While End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() End Sub End Class A While loop can also be finite, meaning will stop looping at some point. Class Program Public Sub BrainPadSetup() Dim count As Integer count = 0 While count < 10 count = count + 1 BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()) End While End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() End Sub End Class What did the last program do? It printed the count from 1 to 10. But count started at 0, not one. Shouldn't it print count 0? Time for debugging (troubleshooting). Start by setting a breakpoint at count = 0 and then step in the code to see what the value of count is (use watch window) and then see why the value 0 was never printed. Think about a fix before looking at the next code. The fix is very easy! Class Program Public Sub BrainPadSetup() Dim count As Integer count = 0 While count < 10 BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()) count = count + 1 End While End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() End Sub End Class What about the 10? Shouldn't the program print Count: 10? The answer is in the while-loop. In plain English, it says: run the following code as long as count is less than 10. Since 10 is not less than 10 then 10 will not be printed. The while-loop can be improved like this: While count <= 10 This new statement says run the loop as long as the count is less than or equals to 10. Exercise Write a program the prints all even numbers between 6 to 66. Nesting Some programs will have loops inside loops, or if-statements inside loops, maybe inside other if-statements and more loops! This is called nesting. While programmers should try to keep this simple to understand, nesting is sometimes required. How do we write a program that prints 1 to 10 repeatedly forever? This is accomplished by having two nested while-loops. One that counts 1 to 10, which goes inside another loop that loops infinitely. Class Program Public Sub BrainPadSetup() Dim count As Integer count = 1 While True While count < 10 BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()) count = count + 1 End While End While End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() End Sub End Class The above program will not work. It will print 1 to 10 one time only then the program will not end and it will not print anything after. Time again for debugging the code to determine what the issue is. Run the program and determine the cause of the error. The fix is simple but try to find it before peeking at the fixed code. Class Program Public Sub BrainPadSetup() Dim count As Integer count = 0 While True count = 1 While count < 10 BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()) count = count + 1 End While End While End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() End Sub End Class Exercise Write a program that prints 0 to 10 repeatedly when the up button is not pressed when it is bright. If it is dark the button doesn't do anything. Do not use And , instead nest the if-statements."

We first need to erase the old bootloader v1: Connect UART0 TX/RX to your PC. The easiest way would be to use a USB-Serial TTL cable. Those are D0 and D1 on FEZ Panda II. Do not forget to connect the ground. Put the device in serial mode by connecting MOD pin to ground. Open a terminal software and set the baudrate to 115200. Press the enter key and you should see BL coming back. Enter this exact line Unlock This device! (case sensitive). Ignore the BL keeps coming back with every key press. If you entered it correctly, you will see Are you sure? Enter Yes (case sensitive). You now have a blank LPC chip! You can now close the terminal software, release MOD pin, and reset your board. The new bootloader v2 can now be loaded. Download and install Flash Magic . Open Flash Magic and select LPC2378. Check \"Erase all Flash\". Set the correct COM port number of your serial connection. Click the Start button. When done, reset the board and the PC will detect a virtual USB device. Loading the Firmware Tip First make sure you have bootloader v2 loaded. This needs to be done only once. To activate bootloader v2, set LDR pin low. On FEZ Panda II it is a button marked LDR. Simply press it.

The firmware update functionality only works for devices that have GHI Bootloader v2 . The TinyCLR Config tool is stil in development. Please stay tuned . Firmware Sources When TinyCLR Config starts up, it looks for a file called FirmwareSources.txt in the same directory as the TinyCLR Config executable itself. If the file isn't present, it's created automatically with one entry pointing to the official GHI firmware store. The file is a comma-separated list of sources, one per line. The first value is an integer priority with lower numbers being searched first. Each source is tried until a newer version than the currently flashed version is found. The next value is either Local or Network which determines where the next value points to: the local disk or the network. The last value is a URI that points to an xml file that defines the list of available firmwares. The firmware xml list is made up of a list of devices. Each device has a name attribute and firmware list child. Within the firmware list is a list of each available firmware. Each firmware must have an MD5 hash that matches the file pointed to, a version of the form major.minor.patch , a release date, and a uri that points to the location of the firmware (the location type must match the location type of the firmware list itself, i.e. local vs network).

    "title": "Native Interops in TinyCLR",
    "keywords": "Native Interops in TinyCLR Interops allow you to write a class in managed code that is partially or entirely implemented in native code. This is useful for time critical tasks, things that would take too long in managed code, or interacting with native functionality not exposed through managed code. Keep in mind that while native code executes, all managed threads are blocked and if you crash in native code, managed code also crashes. To get started, create a TinyCLR project called InteropTest . In the project properties window, go to the TinyCLR OS tab. Check both the Generate native stubs for internal methods and the Generate bare native stubs checkboxes. Next, define your native API. Any method that you plan to implement in native code must be declared extern and be decorated with the System.Runtime.CompilerServices.MethodImpl attribute that is constructed with MethodImplOptions.InternalCall . Static and instance functions, static and instance constructors, finalizers, and property set and get bodies can all be implemented native. They can have any visibility, can take any number or types of parameters, and can return any type. For example: class MyNativeClass { private int field = 5; [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.InternalCall)] public extern string MyNativeFunc(uint param1); public extern int MyNativeProperty { [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.InternalCall)] get; } } Once you have your native API defined, build your project. In the output folder, find and open pe and then Interop . In there are three files that let TinyCLR connect the managed methods to the native methods. There are two main files that have the same name as your project. These define the entire API. Importantly, there is an object that has the assembly name, its checksum, and an array of its methods. The remaining file contains function stubs for each native method you need to implement from the MyNativeClass class. Each function has a single parameter of type TinyCLR_Interop_MethodData that can be found in the TinyCLR.h file. This type has two memebers: an opaque stack type that you pass to other interop functions and the API provider that gives you access to the runtime. You can use this API provider to find the interop provider. The interop provider allows you to read and write object fields, read arguments passed to the function, write to reference arguments, set the return value, raise other events, and create new managed objects. The following code shows reading from a field and setting it as the return value of the property: TinyCLR_Result InteropTest_InteropTest_MyNativeClass::MyNativeProperty___I4(const TinyCLR_Interop_MethodData md) { auto ip = (const TinyCLR_Interop_Provider*)md.ApiProvider.FindDefault(&md.ApiProvider, TinyCLR_Api_Type::InteropProvider); TinyCLR_Interop_ManagedValue self; TinyCLR_Interop_ManagedValue ret; TinyCLR_Interop_ManagedValue field; ret.Type = TinyCLR_Interop_ManagedValueType::I4; ip->GetThisObject(ip, md.Stack, self); ip->GetField(ip, self, InteropTest_InteropTest_MyNativeClass::FIELD___field___I4, field); ip->GetReturn(ip, md.Stack, ret); ret.Data.Numeric->I4 = field.Data.Numeric->I4; return TinyCLR_Result::Success; } Now you need tp compile these files. If you don't have GCC yet, see the porting guide to find out how to install GCC. To compile using GCC, the easiest way is to use a makefile and a scatterfile. We've provided samples of each below. The makefile is setup to compile all cpp in the same directory it is and to do using for a Cortex M4 architecture. If you're not on CortexM4, change the MCU_FLAGS parameter accordingly. The output file is InteropTest.bin . You can change that with the OUTPUT_NAME property. OUTPUT_NAME = InteropTest LINKERSCRIPT_NAME = scatterfile MCU_FLAGS = -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb INC_DIRS = -I. CC = arm-none-eabi-g++.exe LD = arm-none-eabi-g++.exe OC = arm-none-eabi-objcopy.exe CC_FLAGS = $(INC_DIRS) $(MCU_FLAGS) -Os -std=c++11 -xc++ -Wall -Wabi -w -mabi=aapcs -fPIC -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -fno-use-cxa-atexit -fno-threadsafe-statics LD_FLAGS = $(MCU_FLAGS) -nostartfiles -lc -lgcc -T $(LINKERSCRIPT_NAME) -Wl,-Map,$(OUTPUT_NAME).map -Wl,--oformat -Wl,elf32-littlearm OC_FLAGS = -S -O binary SRC_FILES = $(wildcard *.cpp) OBJ_FILES = $(patsubst %.cpp, %.obj, $(SRC_FILES)) rebuild: clean build clean: del $(OBJ_FILES) $(OUTPUT_NAME).bin $(OUTPUT_NAME).elf $(OUTPUT_NAME).map build: $(OBJ_FILES) $(LD) $(LD_FLAGS) -o $(OUTPUT_NAME).elf $^ $(OC) $(OC_FLAGS) $(OUTPUT_NAME).elf $(OUTPUT_NAME).bin %.obj: %.cpp $(CC) -c $(CC_FLAGS) -o $@ $^ Because TinyCLR can't currently dynamically relocate your code, you'll need to provide the proper base and length values for the RLI region in the scatterfile by changing the RLI_BASE and RLI_LENGTH placeholders. You can find the RLI region for your device, if it has one, in the device's specifications. MEMORY { SDRAM (wx) : ORIGIN = RLI_BASE, LENGTH = RLI_LENGTH } SECTIONS { . = ALIGN(4); .text : { *(.text) } .rodata ALIGN(4): { *(.rodata ) } .data ALIGN(4): { *(.data) } .bss ALIGN(4): { *(.bss) } } Lastly, make sure that you place TinyCLR.h in the folder so that the interop files can see it. You need to use the file that corresponds to the release of the firmware you are running. To execute the makefile, you'll need to have make installed. You can get it from a toolkit like MinGW or, if you're on Windows 10, the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Once you have make installed, just navigate to the folder with the makefile and interop files in a shell and execute make build . Tip If you use the Windows Subsystem for Linux, you'll need to change del in the makefile to rm . Once you have a compiled image, look in the map file to find out where the interop definition variable Interop_InteropTest (if you're using the default names) got placed. You'll need to pass this address to the managed function that registers the interop. In managed code, add the compiled binary image as a resource and use the Marshal class to copy it into the correct location in memory. Then call System.Runtime.InteropServices.Interop.Add and pass it the address of the Interop_InteropTest object from the map file. You need to do this every time your program runs and before you call any of the native methods in your interop class. var interop = Resources.GetBytes(Resources.BinaryResources.InteropTest); Marshal.Copy(interop, 0, new IntPtr(0x20016000), interop.Length); Interop.Add(new IntPtr(0x2001607C)); var cls = new MyNativeClass(); var val = cls.MyNativeProperty;"

    "keywords": "ADC Unlike digital input pins, which can only read high or low; analog pins can read a range of voltage levels. Microcontrollers based on 3.3V can typically read voltages anywhere between zero and 3.3V. Analog inputs connect internally to a Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) that converts the analog voltage level on the pin to a digital value. The resolution of the ADC determines its accuracy. An 8bit ADC has 256 steps to work with, 3.3V/256=0.013V. This means an increase of 0.013V will increase the value by one. In other words, a voltage change of less than 0.013V has no effect. The ADC on FEZ is 12bit and should fit most needs. Tip Note that the analog channel number is not the pin number. We have these easily enumerated for FEZ but you need to determine the channel number on a specific pin using your system's documentation. This example will read the ratio, that is 0 to 1, of an analog input. After running the program, connect a wire from the analog pin to ground and you should see a zero or something really close to zero. Connect to 3.3V and you will see 1 or something close, like 0.99. using System; using System.Diagnostics; using System.Threading; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Adc; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins; class Program { static void Main() { AdcController ADC = AdcController.GetDefault(); AdcChannel analog = ADC.OpenChannel(FEZ.AdcChannel.A0); while(true) { double d = analog.ReadRatio(); Debug.WriteLine(\"An-> \" + d.ToString(\"N2\")); Thread.Sleep(100); } } }"

    "keywords": "Threading and Events Methods The BrainPad object (or class) includes methods to control many aspects of the BrainPad's hardware. A method is a set of instructions grouped together. If a student is asked to speak, the command may look like Student.Say(\"Hello\") . The Say() method is simple, but speaking requires many things like taking in air and moving your vocal cords. In the same sense, activating the LightBulb and Turning it green is a simple request but internally it does many small tasks to reach the final goal. Methods can also take arguments. For example, you could have a method called Student.Run() to order a student to run or Student.Run(slow) to order them to run slow. Methods can also return a value, like Student.GetAge() which returns the student's age. In the code example below, we show how a method called Add can be add 5 + 2 and print the total integer to the Output window. We've also added an additional line to display the result on the BrainPad's own display too. public class Program { public void BrainPadSetup() { int total = Add(5, 2); BrainPad.WriteToComputer(total); BrainPad.Display.DrawNumberAndShowOnScreen(1, 1, total); } public void BrainPadLoop() { // Declared but not used } public int Add(int a, int b) { return a + b; } } The above example creates a simple method that takes two integer arguments and returns an integer. The method will add the two arguments and return the results. Method names are like variable names, only certain things are allowed. Method names cannot start with a number, contain a symbol besides the underscore �_� or have a space in them. The following examples show proper and improper use of method names. Valid Method Names bool AreAll4ButtonsPressed() string Add(int a, int b) Poorly named Methods bool areallbuttonspressed() int method34from94handler() Note: Method names should always be easy to read and meaningful. This allows a programmer to easily discern what it does. Invalid Method Names bool Are All Buttons Pressed() bool AreAllButtonsPressed?() Methods are not required to return anything. To fill that case of not returning a value the keyword void is used. void ActivateAlarm() Finally, methods can also be private or public and static or non-static. This is beyond the scope of this course and public static will always be used. Overloading Methods The same method name can have one or more argument types. Depending on the argument passed to the method, the system will determine which method to call as shown in in the code sample below we create a method called Test which can handle both an integer or a double. public class Program { public void BrainPadSetup() { Test(5); Test(5.0); } public void BrainPadLoop() { // Declared but not used } public void Test(int x) { BrainPad.WriteToComputer(\"integer\"); BrainPad.Display.DrawSmallText(1,1,\"integer\"); BrainPad.Display.ShowOnScreen(); } public void Test(double x) { BrainPad.WriteToComputer(\"double\"); BrainPad.Display.DrawSmallText(1, 20, \"double\"); BrainPad.Display.ShowOnScreen(); } } In the code above, you'll notice in the BrainPadSetup() we use the Test() method twice, once with a integer (5) and then with a double (5.0) . When the Test() method is called the computer determines what the data type is and routes to the appropriate method. This is what is meant by overloading a method. Boolean Variables In programming we use true or false to represent the truth values of logic. These values are known as Boolean or bool when coding. For example, let's say we need to check if the up and down buttons are pressed in multiple spots throughout our program. We could check each button in each spot or we could create a reusable method that returns true if both are pressed or false otherwise, as shown in the code examples below. public class Program { public void BrainPadSetup() { // Declared but not used } public void BrainPadLoop() { if (UpAndDownPressed()) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); } else { rainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } } public bool UpAndDownPressed() { if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsUpPressed() && BrainPad.Buttons.IsDownPressed()) { return true; } else { return false; } } } The new Keyword In the examples used so far, the BrainPad object has been used directly. This will not work for all object types. Remember the Student.Say(\"Hello\") example? This statement is not completely valid because we don't know which student is going to say �Hello�. To access a specific student, you need to create a variable named mike to hold the Student object as shown in the code sample below. Student mike = new Student(); Threading Threading in the programming world is a way to describe multitasking. Each task is a thread that runs separately. The threading support in TinyCLR OS on the BrainPad is easy to work with. First, we need to inform the system that the threading library needs to be imported. We do this by adding the code below to the very top of our program, where other libraries are also imported. Like the using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.BrainPad; library, that allows us to program using the BrainPad object. using System.Threading; Before adding a thread, we need a method for it to use as shown in the code below. public class Program { public void BrainPadSetup() { Thread blinkerThread = new Thread(Blinker); blinkerThread.Start(); while (true) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.1); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); } } public void BrainPadLoop() { // Declared but not used } public void Blinker() { while (true) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2); } } } The previous program will blink the light green Stepping through code, we can easily see how the Blinker method never returns execution to BrainPadSetup(). The program keeps looping infinitely inside the Blinker method. But most programs would probably need to blink the light while doing something else. This is where threads come in very handy. First, we need to construct a Thread object as shown below. This object has special internal control over the program flow. Thread blinkerThread = new Thread(Blinker); Note how the names easily identify what they represent. The blinkerThread() method is a thread that handles the Blinker() method. All we need to do is Start() the thread and the Blinker() method will be executed. However, there is still an issue. The BrainPadSetup() method will reach the end, which will cause the program and all its threads to terminate. A temporary solution is to make the BrainPadSetup() method wait indefinitely is by using -1 milliseconds as shown in the code example below. public class Program { public void BrainPadSetup() { Thread blinkerThread = new Thread(Blinker); blinkerThread.Start(); BrainPad.Wait.Milliseconds(-1); } public void BrainPadLoop() { // Declared but not used } public void Blinker() { while (true) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2); } } } In code example below, while the red light is blinking in its own thread, the system can now go do other things like incrementing our count variable and showing the results on the display. public class Program { int count = 0; public void BrainPadSetup() { Thread blinkerThread = new Thread(Blinker); blinkerThread.Start(); while (true) { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.1); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); } } public void BrainPadLoop() { // Declared but not used } public void Blinker() { while (true) { count = count + 1; BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(40,25,\" \"+ count); } } } Events If a program needs to turn a light on via a button press, that program will need to check the button's state indefinitely. How often should we check the button? What if the button was pressed and released before the check? If we check too fast the system cannot enter low power mode. This is important for battery operated devices like circuit boards or mobile phones. If the phone was always fully on, the battery would not last more than a few minutes. The only way a mobile phone can last an entire day on a charged battery is by shutting off unneeded components (like turning the screen off). The proper way to handle the button is to subscribe to an event that is fired when the button is pressed or released. The BrainPad's BrainPad.Buttons.WhenUpButtonPressed event allows us to subscribe using the += symbols. Now every time the Up button is pressed the Buttons_WhenUpButtonPressed() method is called. In the example below we've created event handlers for all the buttons on the BrainPad. There is a handler to also check when the button is released as shown in the code below. public class Program { public void BrainPadSetup() { BrainPad.Buttons.WhenUpButtonPressed += Buttons_WhenUpButtonPressed; BrainPad.Buttons.WhenDownButtonPressed += Buttons_WhenDownButtonPressed; BrainPad.Buttons.WhenRightButtonPressed += Buttons_WhenRightButtonPressed; BrainPad.Buttons.WhenLeftButtonPressed += Buttons_WhenLeftButtonPressed; BrainPad.Buttons.WhenUpButtonReleased += Buttons_WhenUpButtonReleased; BrainPad.Buttons.WhenDownButtonReleased += Buttons_WhenDownButtonReleased; BrainPad.Buttons.WhenRightButtonReleased += Buttons_WhenRightButtonReleased; BrainPad.Buttons.WhenLeftButtonReleased += Buttons_WhenLeftButtonReleased; } private void Buttons_WhenUpButtonPressed() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed(); } private void Buttons_WhenDownButtonPressed() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); } private void Buttons_WhenRightButtonPressed() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnBlue(); } private void Buttons_WhenLeftButtonPressed() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnWhite(); } private void Buttons_WhenUpButtonReleased() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } private void Buttons_WhenDownButtonReleased() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } private void Buttons_WhenRightButtonReleased() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } private void Buttons_WhenLeftButtonReleased() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } public void BrainPadLoop() { } } When typing, after you enter the += symbols, Visual Studio will instruct you to press TAB to insert a pre-named event handler. After doing so, you'll want to press TAB again to generate the actual handler inside the class. Activating a light on a button press can be done in a loop but then the system is always running. Using events in this example, the system is mostly sleeping (in low power mode). The first thing it does is subscribe to the button event. The system sleeps until one of the buttons is pressed or released, at which point it wakes up and runs the appropriate Button method. But the code above can be simplified a bit more. Since each ButtonReleased method in our program does the same thing we can share a single event as demonstrated in the code below. public class Program { public void BrainPadSetup() { BrainPad.Buttons.WhenUpButtonPressed += Buttons_WhenUpButtonPressed; BrainPad.Buttons.WhenDownButtonPressed += Buttons_WhenDownButtonPressed; BrainPad.Buttons.WhenRightButtonPressed += Buttons_WhenRightButtonPressed; BrainPad.Buttons.WhenLeftButtonPressed += Buttons_WhenLeftButtonPressed; BrainPad.Buttons.WhenUpButtonReleased += Buttons_WhenButtonReleased; BrainPad.Buttons.WhenDownButtonReleased += Buttons_WhenButtonReleased; BrainPad.Buttons.WhenRightButtonReleased += Buttons_WhenButtonReleased; BrainPad.Buttons.WhenLeftButtonReleased += Buttons_WhenButtonReleased; } private void Buttons_WhenUpButtonPressed() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed(); } private void Buttons_WhenDownButtonPressed() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); } private void Buttons_WhenRightButtonPressed() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnBlue(); } private void Buttons_WhenLeftButtonPressed() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnWhite(); } private void Buttons_WhenButtonReleased() { BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); } public void BrainPadLoop() { } } In the above code, we've accomplish the same thing as before using a few less lines of code. This might not always be the case. But since each button release does the same thing we can simplify our code by sharing the Buttons_WhenButtonReleased() method with all our Button Release events."

Loading the Firmware Using TinyCLR Config TinyCLR Config tool includes multiple features developers need to work with TinyCLR-OS-enabled devices. It simplifies the firmware update and it includes options for accessing the TinyCLR firmware at runtime. Using this tool is the recommended path; however, the manual instructions are included on this page. Read more on the TinyCLR Config page. Manual Loading the Firmware TinyCLR Config tool should be used to update the firmware. As a backup, use these instructions: Set your board in the bootloader mode. Each product has a specific way to enter the boot loader. Open any terminal software, for example Tera Term . Select serial and pick the COM port associated with your board. (If unsure, check Device Manager) Press V and then enter. You will see back the boot loader version number (v2.x.x) Press U or X and then enter. Use X for firmware file type GHI and U for firmware file type GLB. Press Y to confirm then enter. You will now see CCCC ... Go to File -> Transfer -> XMODEM -> Send and then check the 1K option. Select the firmware file. When the transfer is complete, reset your board. GLB File Format The glb files that are loaded onto devices have some additional metadata that help the bootloader function in addition to the raw data itself. The first 1,024 bytes of a glb file is the upload header. Starting from offset 0 are the below fields. The rest of the header is currently reserved. 32 bit signature number that is unique for each device. 32 bit unsigned address in flash that this image should be copied to. 32 bit unsigned length of the image to flash rounded to the nearest 1,024 bytes. 16 bit CRC-CCITT of the image. After the upload header is the actual image to flash. If its length is not divisible by 1,024 bytes, it is padded until it is. For images that are meant to be bootable, the address in the upload header should be set to the entry point defined for the specific device. Bootable images have an additional 1,024 byte header at the beginning of the image that is used to verify the image before booting it. The boot image is also padded to the nearest 1,024 bytes. Starting from offset 0 are the below fields. The rest of the header is currently reserved. 32 bit signature number that is unique for each device. 32 bit unsigned address in flash that is the entry point the bootloader will invoke. 32 bit unsigned length of the boot image rounded to the nearest 1,024 bytes. 16 bit CRC-CCITT of the boot image bounded by the specified address and length. Bootloader v1 Currently the USBizi, EMX, G120, and G120E ship with this version of the bootloader. All results are terminated with LF (\\n). Commands are executed as soon as they entered without waiting for a new-line. \"BL\" or \"Done.\" will be sent after each command. On startup, a banner is sent that is terminated by \"BL\". Once the banner is received, you are free to enter any of the case-sensitive single-character commands described below. V: returns the current version. E: erases all user sectors of the device (* is sent while erasing). R: runs the firmware if present. B: increases the baud rate in serial mode to 921,600. X: upload a file to the device using 1K XMODEM. Only send *.ghi files meant for your device. The firmware is automatically run after a successful upload.

All you need to get started is Visual Studio, a TinyCLR device, and a USB cable. Tip TinyCLR OS is still an alpha so there is still a lot more to come! TinyCLR OS is made for .NET developers. Threading, memory management, timers, event handlers, and many more exist in TinyCLR OS just like they do on full .NET. For interacting with hardware, TinyCLR OS has an API similar to the Windows 10 IoT Core Extensions API that you may already be familiar with. GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, ADC, DAC, PWM, and more are all available for you to interact with the embedded world. Better yet, all libraries are available through NuGet. Because of this, there will be no SDK to install or machines to lock to specific versions. Simply use NuGet to download any needed version of any needed library on a per-project basis. To set a system to use TinyCLR OS: If you don't already have Visual Studio 2017, download and install the freely available Visual Studio Community 2017 . Make sure to select the .NET desktop development workload when installing Visual Studio. Download and install the newest TinyCLR OS Visual Studio extension . Connect your device to your PC using a USB cable. Don't have a TinyCLR OS device yet? There are many supported boards . Start Visual Studio and create a new TinyCLR Application under C# > TinyCLR . New to Visual Studio or C#? Take a look at the getting started guide from Microsoft . Add some code and press F5 to deploy and begin debugging your application! Since TinyCLR OS is still so new, we haven't yet uploaded any packages to NuGet, so make sure to download the newest libraries , extract the archive, and place them in a local NuGet feed . Do not forget to update the firmware on your board . You are now ready to get started with TinyCLR! Take a look at the tutorials to get going. Tip If you're an existing user of NETMF and still want to use it in addition to TinyCLR OS, don't worry. TinyCLR OS is completely independent of NETMF and works side-by-side with no issues. Take a look at the release notes to see what's new and the roadmap to see what we have planned. Interested in running TinyCLR OS on your own device? Take a look at the porting guide for information on how to get started."

    "title": "Alpha Release Notes",
    "keywords": "Alpha Release Notes 0.6.0 on 2017-08-31 Notes This release adds support for the G400 and all of our previous NXP based devices: G120, EMX, Embedded Master, and USBizi. There are new LPC17 and LPC24 ports and ARM7, ARM9, and CortexM3 builds of the core now available in the GitHub repo . There are new classes available in the Pins library to go along with these new ports. The other major changes in this release are fixed automatic loading of USB drivers, updated bootloaders for devices, continued improvements to the BrainPad library, Acquire and Release were added to all native APIs, native interops have increased functionality, and sharing modes for devices are now supported. Also available in this release is a very early preview of the new TinyCLR Config tool. It can be used to check your device for updates over the internet and install an update if found (if the device has the GHI Bootloader version 2); save, load, erase, pause, and resume the managed application; and capture debug messages. More functionality is planned. See here for more information. Relatedly, we are also making signed drivers for the GHI Bootloader available for Windows 7 and 8. These drivers are not needed on Windows 10 or newer. Lastly, how we distribute releases is changing going forward. There's no longer one monolithic archive to download. Instead, everything TinyCLR can be found on its downloads page and bootloader binaries are available on the bootloader download page. MD5 hashes are provided for all downloads as well. Libraries Changes Split ReadTemperature in BrainPad to ReadTemperatureInCelsius and ReadTemperatureInFahrenheit . Moved Picture out of BrainPad.Display . Moved BrainPad.Expansion to the pins library. Changed the original BrainPad display driver to only allocate memory on first use. Added basic STM32F4, LPC17, LPC23, LPC24, and AT91 processor definitions to the pins library. Added many more devices to the pins library. Updated many pin names to match the processor name more closely (particularly COM to UART). Calls to *Provider.FromId in devices with the same id now return the same object instance. Sharing modes for the various providers in the devices library are now supported. Software I2C works correctly again. Added Environment.NewLine . Known Issues Formatting numbers that cross an assembly boundary can throw an exception. Support for the embedded Visual Basic runtime is incomplete and some uses may throw cryptic compile errors. Partially transparent ellipses have weird artifacts. Pins are not currently reserved so you can create multiple objects on the same pin which behave incorrectly. Firmware Changes Fixed the device not loading drivers over USB. Added clicker and clicker2. Added G400, G120, EMX, Embedded Master, and USBizi. Renamed FEZ to FEZCLR and FEZCerberus to Cerb #8 . Refactored specific devices out of the build script and into configuration files #6 . Corrected the incorrect index being passed to TinyCLR_Startup_SetDebugger #3 . Fixed PWM beyond timer 8 on on STM32F4 boards not functioning. Reworked the GPIO functions in the ports to more closely match the processor's API. Added ARM7, ARM9, and Cortex M3 targets. Added a flag for whether or not to run TinyCLR after rebooting. Added Acquire and Release to GPIO, ADC, DAC, PWM, Interop, Task, Memory, and API providers. Interop GetReturn now sets the return type automatically but will no longer create an array, object, or string (call CreateObject yourself after). Interop ReplaceObject now functions. Strings can now be manipulated in interops. Interops now support DateTime and TimeSpan objects by exposing them as U8. Added FindType to interops for finding a specific managed typed by name and assembly. Objects in interops now track the type of the object as well with the TinyCLR_Interop_ManagedObjectType type. Very basic object creation in interops has been added, but it fails in many cases and does not run any constructor. Removed the stack parameter from ReplaceObject in interop. Known Issues Rapidly pressing the buttons on the BrainPad may corrupt the display. Many UART properties and events are not implemented. Deploying over USB when out of memory crashes the board.

TinyCLR Config Changes Initial release. Known Issues The Update Firmware action won't work in this release because changes were needed in the firmware. Use the Loader tab to manually update the firmware. This will not be required in the next release as long as you have the firmware from this release or newer on the device. TinyCLR Config may not function properly with devices running firmwares from before this release due to changes in the communication protocols. Extension Changes Added a using for GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.BrainPad to the C# BrainPad Application template. Removed Expansion from the VB and C# BrainPad application templates. Updated URLs in the various NuGet and VSIX packages. Forced parity to none when using the serial debugger interface instead of using what the port configures. Known Issues Some uses of pattern matching may crash the C# compiler. Visual Basic resources page generates an incompatible resource file. Visual Basic resource files are wrapped in a second namespace. When adding an image or font to a resx file a reference to the drawing assembly is not automatically added. 0.5.0 on 2017-07-07 Notes This release focuses on the public porting library and API -- though there are a few minor fixes and changes in other areas. As part of the new porting experience, we are also releasing a very early build of TinyCLR for the Netduino 3 and Quail mainboard! You can now port TinyCLR OS to run on your own system using the header file and library we provide -- as long as your architecture is supported. Currently, only Cortex M4 is available. Keep in mind the available API is still alpha and may change, especially USB client. See here for details. You can also create your own managed functions that can call into native code that you provide. These will be automatically wired into the system for a seamless experience. See here for details. To support this, we added a few more classes under System.Runtime.InteropServices . Most important is the Interop class. It allows you to add and remove interops from the system by providing it with the address in memory of the interop definition table. It expects you to load it into memory yourself using the Marshal class. You can use FindAll to get back a list of all interops registered in the system and RaiseEvent to trigger an event on the specified native event dispatcher. The NativeEventDispatcher class allows you to get an instance of the class to receive events that the specified dispatcher name receives (either from native code or Interop.RaiseEvent ). It has a single event that gets triggered whenever an event is received. There is only one instance per dispatcher name, so calls to GetDispatcher with the same name will return the same instance. Similar to Interop , Api can be used to add and remove native APIs from the system. It expects you to load the API into memory yourself and pass it the address of the API definition. You can query all registered APIs, find a specific API by name and type, and parse and creator selectors. Selectors are a string that represents an API name and index into its implementations of the form \"name\\index\". A default selector is set so that a specific API type can be returned without knowing the exact name, like the default GPIO controller on a system. The Api class is used internally by the devices library to talk to the native implementation via the implementation IntPtr provided for the given API name and index. In some cases you can use the GetDefault method on a given device provider to return the default registered API. If there is no default, like for PWM and others, you can pass the Id property in the specific pins class to the desired device provider. We added Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer to enable you to create a quick native interop for a specific address in memory that takes a single ref IntPtr parameter and returns nothing. DeviceInformation was also added to return the device name, manufacturer, and version set on the native side. After flashing the firmware for the first time on any device, Windows may still use the old NETMF USB IDs preventing the device from being seen by TinyCLR. Uninstall the device from the Device Manager and reinstall it to fix it. To update the firmware on pre-Windows 10 machines, you will need the bootloader drivers provided by our existing 2016 R1 NETMF SDK . Libraries Changes Added running device detection. Added listing, adding, and removing system interops. Added listing, adding, and removing system APIs. Added Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer . Added NativeEventDispatcher . Added provider IDs to pins. Added FEZ pinout. Added Expansion to BrainPad. Updated devices library to use the provider and native API model via a Provider class for each type. Core assembly was renamed to mscorlib . GetDeviceSelector and DeviceInformation.FindAll now throw an exception on use. Opening a non-existent UART now throws on construction. Changed DateTime.Ticks to use the same epoch as the desktop. Gpio write now fires ValueChanged . BrainPad accelerometer now uses the proper axes and scaling. BrainPad Image was renamed to Picture . BrainPad WriteOnComputer was renamed to WriteToComputer . BrainPad Servo SetMaxPulseWidth now has correct range in the exception message. Increased the duration and frequency of the BrainPad buzzer beep. Original BrainPad display now works. Replaced AutoShow flag on BrainPad with DrawTextAndShowOnScreen methods. Reworked BrainPad Servo API. Removed BrainPad Board class. Known Issues Software I2C can lock up the board if a slave device isn't connected or responds improperly. Formatting numbers that cross an assembly boundary can throw an exception. Support for the embedded Visual Basic runtime is incomplete and some uses may throw cryptic compile errors. Device sharing modes are not respected. Partially transparent ellipses have weird artifacts. Pins are not currently reserved so you can create multiple objects on the same pin which behave incorrectly. Software I2C does not work. Firmware Changes Initial FEZ Cerberus, FEZ, Netduino 3, and Quail firmware release. All peripherals are now properly reset on startup. Gpio write values are stored when not in output model. Fixed PWM jittering. All frequencies now round down. Fixed gpio interrupts being slow and something getting missed. Known Issues Rapidly pressing the buttons on the BrainPad may corrupt the display. GpioChangeWriter generates an incorrect signal for periods above 50ms on G400. An 0xA2000000 error is sent over the debug transport when there is no deployment present. Many UART properties and events are not implemented. There is no firmware for G120 and G400 in this release. PWM on controller 8 and up does not work on the G80. Deploying over USB when out of memory crashes the board. Extension Changes Removed stray semicolon in BrainPad Visual Basic template. Changed BrainPad templates to have a BrainPad static class in them. Reduced the number of retries for connecting to device. Added namespace to C# BrainPad template. Known Issues The device may not load drivers on Windows 7 preventing Visual Studio from seeing it. Some uses of pattern matching may crash the C# compiler. Visual Basic resources page generates an incompatible resource file. Visual Basic resource files are wrapped in a second namespace. When adding an image or font to a resx file a reference to the drawing assembly is not automatically added. Porting Changes Initial release of porting library and API. Known Issues Marshalling strings does not work. Marshalling DateTime and TimeSpan does not work. Creating and replacing managed objects does not work. CAN and USB host are missing. The USB client API is still very rough and will change. 0.4.0 on 2017-05-10 Notes This release primarily fixes several bugs; implements more of the serial API; adds DataReader , DataWriter , and Marshal classes; and reworks a lot of the BrainPad API. A new Storage library was added that moves some large members (like DataReader ) out of Devices that you may not always needed. There is more to be added to this library down the road. SignalGenerator , SignalCapture , and PulseFeedback were renamed to match the Windows 10 counterparts. Their API will be updated to match as well in a future release. The Marshal class under System.Runtime.InteropServices can be used like the old Register and AddressSpace classes to read and write memory. It also adds allocating and releasing unmanaged memory from the managed side that can be manipulated from the other members. You can see a quick example on using the new serial API here . You must use either the DataReader and DataWriter classes or use the WindowsRuntimeBufferExtensions to manipulate a Buffer since the internal array is no longer publicly accessible to match the UWP API. Pay attention to the Load and Store members. You can't read before calling Load and writes do not get flushed until you call Store . There has been no change to the G120 and G400 bootloaders in this release so you do not need to update them if you already have them on your device from the 0.3.0 release. After flashing the firmware for the first time on any device, Windows may still use the old NETMF USB IDs preventing the device from being seen by TinyCLR. Uninstall the device from the Device Manager and reinstall it to fix it. To update the firmware on pre-Windows 10 machines, you will need the bootloader drivers provided by our existing 2016 R1 NETMF SDK . Libraries Changes Fixed GpioPin.ValueChanged sender parameter type to be GpioPin. Fixed many of the Debug and Trace members not functioning properly. Fixed LowLevelDevicesController.DefaultProvider throwing an exception when null instead of falling back to the built-in providers. Fixed SerialDevice.Read not respecting the ReadTimeout value. Fixed SerialDevice.BytesReceived and IBuffer.Length not getting updated when reading. Fixed the exception that was thrown in BrainPad.Buttons when buttons are pressed. Fixed the exception that was thrown when using BrainPad.ServoMotor . Fixed PWM glicthing other pins on the same controller when changing one pin. Fixed Thread.Sleep not always sleeping for the proper amount of time. Fixed SerialDevice.ErrorReceived not being raised. Added EventArgs . Added WindowsRuntimeBufferExtensions . Added DataReader and DataWriter . Added various From methods to TimeSpan . Added InteropServices.Marshal . Added EditorBrowsable attribute to several members inherited from object to the BrainPad members. Added GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Storage with WindowsRuntimeBufferExtensions , DataReader , and DataWriter in it. Updated the underlying value of the SerialError enum. Updated the BrainPad to be based around instance properties rather than static classes. Updated SerialDevice.Read to only support InputStreamOptions.Partial and InputStreamOptions.None . Moved InputStreamOptions , IInputStream , IOutputStream , IBuffer , and Buffer to the GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Core assembly. Moved the BrainPad expansion pins to the pins library. Improved support for the original BrainPad in the driver. Improved many of the BrainPad APIs. Removed the members of Buffer that don't conform to the UWP API. Renamed SignalGenerator to GpioChangeWriter , SignalCapture to GpioChangeReader , and PulseFeedback to GpioPulseReaderWriter . Known Issues The original BrainPad display does not currently work with the GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.BrainPad library. Software I2C can lock up the board if a slave device isn't connected or responds improperly. ServoMotors.SetMaxPulseWidth has an invalid range in the exception message. Formatting numbers that cross an assembly boundary can throw an exception. Opening a non-existent UART will only throw when it is used. Support for the embedded Visual Basic runtime is incomplete and some uses may throw cryptic compile errors. Firmware Changes Fixed the G30 sometimes getting stuck during deployment. Added another sector to the G30 deployment region. Known Issues Rapidly pressing the buttons on the BrainPad may corrupt the display. Gpio interrupts may be slow when Visual Studio is connected. Some frequencies may round up instead of down if the requested frequency cannot be met. An 0xA2000000 error is sent over the debug transport when there is no deployment present. GpioChangeWriter does not generate proper signals for periods above 50ms on G400. Extension Changes Added a flag on the TinyCLR OS property page to control stub generation style. Added the DebuggerNonUserCode attribute to the startup code in BrainPad templates. Removed the public modifier from the C# application template. Known Issues The Visual Basic BrainPad template has a semicolon in the startup file. The device may not load drivers on Windows 7 preventing Visual Studio from seeing it. Some uses of pattern matching may crash the C# compiler. Visual Basic resources page generates an incompatible resource file. Visual Basic resource files are wrapped in a second namespace. When adding an image or font to a resx file a reference to the drawing assembly is not automatically added. 0.3.0 on 2017-04-06 Notes This release has several API additions. Some were added as features themselves (software SPI, SignalGenerator, etc) while others were added to support certain features (the VB runtime, string.Format, MemoryStream and IntPtr for Drawing, etc). We're working to align ourselves with the various .NET Reference Sources available. You'll also see many new icons throughout, application templates for the BrainPad, and common item templates. The NuGet packages that have dependencies (such as on Core), now require the major and minor versions to match. For example, the 0.3.0 Devices library depends on Core [0.3.0,0.4.0). This is to further our use of SemVer so that the native interop checksum only changes in major and minor versions. See the NuGet docs for more information. The biggest addition is the drawing library. It was designed to mirror System.Drawing from the desktop. The basic API is there but there is still more work to be done. To support this, a DisplayController was added to the devices library to configure the display. Since there is no config yet you need to configure the display every time your program starts. A notable change from NETMF is calling flush on a drawing surface the size of the display will no longer draw to the display. Only drawing surfaces created from the FromHdc method passing in the Hdc value from the DisplayController will flush to the display. At this time, only bmp images are supported. Make sure you add a reference to GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Drawing if using bitmap or font resources. Since it's in NuGet now it isn't automatically added. Support for Visual Basic has also been reenabled. One important thing to keep in mind is that there is no longer a Microsoft.VisualBasic assembly. We are using the embedded runtime option provided by Roslyn. It relies on several APIs being present in the core library. We added several of the key APIs needed to enable common usage scenarios. If you find you're getting cryptic compile errors from locations not in your code, let us know so we can evaluate what additional APIs are required. Since the UWP API only supports a controller wide frequency, we had to rework PWM a little bit. There is no longer one controller like there is for GPIO, instead one controller exists for each frequency source. On devices like the G30 and G80, this is a timer. On devices like the G400, there are independent registers for each channel (so unfortunately there will be one controller per channel). The pins library has been updated to organize PwmPin around controllers. SignalGenerator, SignalCapture, and PulseFeedback have also been added, but their APIs will change in a future release to match the UWP style. You can also now change what gets returned by GetDefault calls on the various controllers by updating LowLevelDevicesController.DefaultProvider. The Diagnostics namespace now matches the desktop version more closely. WriteLineIf and Assert were added to Debug and Trace was added as well. All methods on Debug and Trace are marked with the Conditional attribute as expected using the DEBUG and TRACE constants respectively. There's also now a Listeners property on each. This is a collection that you can add to so you can receive whatever is written to Trace or Debug by registering a class derived from TraceListener. As on the desktop, both Trace and Debug share the same listener collection. By default, the collection is populated with a listener that prints to the debug transport which is now at Debugger.Log. Collect and GetTotalMemory were added to GC. Note that GetTotalMemory returns the amount of memory used, not free, to match the desktop. We're investigating APIs to return the amount free. The last notable change is that we implemented IntPtr and UIntPtr. For now, they're only used as the type of the Hdc property in drawing. We expect them to be used in more places going forward. Since these two types map to native int and native unsigned int in the CLR and the managed compilers emit those types when they encounter IntPtr or UIntPtr, we have also added initial support for those types in the interpreter and runtime as well. Let us know if you encounter any weird or hard to explain runtime issues. This release also includes the firmware for the G400. It requires an updated bootloader from the one provided on the G400 bootloader installation page . Simply download the bootloader installer from the installation page and replace Bootloader.bin with the bootloader provided in the TinyCLR download package (making sure to rename it to Bootloader.bin). This updated bootloader can still be used to install the NETMF G400 firmware. It will eventually replace the one provided on the installation page. After flashing the firmware for the first time on any device, Windows may still use the old NETMF USB IDs preventing the device from being seen by TinyCLR. Uninstall the device from the Device Manager and reinstall it to fix it. To update the firmware on pre-Windows 10 machines, you will need the bootloader drivers provided by our existing 2016 R1 NETMF SDK . You can see some examples of the new APIs added in this release here . Libraries Changes PWM now has one controller per frequency source (usually a hardware timer) allowing different frequencies for each controller. string.Format should now work in all cases. Formatting numbers (ToString(\"N2\"), etc) should now work in all cases. I2C read/write partial functions now return the proper result. Opening non-existent ports no longer crashes the firmware. CultureInfo, NumberFormatInfo, and DateTimeFormatInfo now implement IFormatProvider. Primitives (except Boolean), DateTime, TimeSpan, Guid, and Enum now implement IFormattable. Added the == and != operators to Guid. Added a drawing library and display configuration. Added Enum.GetUnderlyingType Added LowLevelDevicesController and the provider API model for SPI, I2C, GPIO. Added SignalGenerator, SignalCapture, and PulseFeedback. Added software providers for I2C and SPI. Added CompilerGenerated, SuppressMessage, and In attributes. Added class target to Conditional attribute. Added FormatException and OverflowException. Added InvariantCulture and CurrentCulture to CultureInfo. Added FormattableString and FormattableStringFactory. Added Collect and GetTotalMemory to GC. Added MemoryStream. Added parts of the CodeContracts namespace. Added implementations to IntPtr and UIntPtr. Added Debugger.Log. Added Trace. Added Assert and WriteLineIf to Debug. Added listeners collection to Trace and Debug and a default listener mapped to Debugger.Log. Added BrainPad. Known Issues The sender parameter in the ValueChanged event on GpioPin is an instance of IGpioPinProvider, not GpioPin. Opening a non-existent UART will only throw when it is used. SignalGenerator may fail for small durations. An exception is thrown in BrainPad.Buttons when buttons are pressed. An exception is thrown when using BrainPad.ServoMotor. Some frequencies may round up instead of down if the requested frequency cannot be met. In the Debug class, only WriteLine(string) functions correctly. Firmware Changes G30 should no longer get stuck at waiting for device to initialize. PWM no longer takes 40 seconds to start on the G30 and G80. GPIO interrupts now work on the G120E. Added support for native int and native unsigned int in runtime Added G400 firmware. Known Issues Deploying to the G30 sometimes fails when writing a sector. An 0xA2000000 error is sent over the debug transport when there is no deployment present. Extension Changes Assemblies larger than sector size can now be deployed. Added Visual Basic support. Added BrainPad Application templates Added common item templates. Added icons throughout. NuGet packages now have a better range dependency for dealing with assembly checksums. Known Issues Visual Basic resources page generates an incompatible resource file. Visual Basic resource files are wrapped in a second namespace. Support for the embedded Visual Basic runtime is incomplete and some uses may throw cryptic compile errors. When adding an image or font to a resx file a reference to the drawing assembly is not automatically added. 0.2.0 on 2017-03-07 Notes You cannot use projects you made for the 0.1.0 version. You must recreate them and re-add your code files because of the changes to the project templates to make them more closely align them with the desktop .NET templates -- you'll notice the only difference is a few properties which prevent inclusion of reference assemblies. The templates also use the .NET Framework 4.5.2 target framework. This is only for NuGet compatibility going forward and does not mean you can use other libraries targeting that framework. This was done in anticipation of broader project system support of the new PackageReference format currently used in .NET Core which fails with unknown target frameworks. The MSBuild package is no longer provided or required. The metadata processor tool has moved internally to the extension and is invoked during deployment to the device. This means that pe and pdbx files are no longer redistributed with their assemblies -- they appear in a pe folder under the output directory when you deploy. We have also rewritten how dependencies are detected for deployment. If you notice any weird failures around assembly resolution or deployment, let us know and send us the entire project as-is so we can diagnose it. The information displayed while deploying to the device has also been improved to show more information about what is going on and what stage the deployment is in. We've also reworked incremental deployment so that assemblies are deployed one to a flash sector (if space allows) to enable re-deploying only the assemblies that have changed on a sector by sector basis. This greatly increases deployment speed on devices which a large number of flash sectors allocated to deployment. This release also includes the firmware for the G120 and G120E. Because the current GHI bootloader on the G120 expects to load TinyBooter, we have provided a second stage bootloader with this preview that you must deploy using the existing GHI bootloader as if you were deploying TinyBooter. Once it is deployed and you restart the device, you'll notice that it starts our newer GHI bootloader 2.0 . You can then use this second bootloader to deploy the TinyCLR OS firmware. Asserting LDR0 will enter the second bootloader while asserting both LDR0 and LDR1 will enter the original bootloader and allow you to return to NETMF. After flashing the firmware the first time, Windows may still use the old NETMF USB IDs preventing the device from being seen by TinyCLR. Uninstall the device from the Device Manager and reinstall it to fix it. To update the firmware on pre-Windows 10 machines, you will need the bootloader drivers provided by our existing 2016 R1 NETMF SDK . Libraries Changes Formatting numbers works in more cases. The built in \"en\" culture has been removed. The dependency on GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.MsBuild has been removed. The pe and pdbx files are no longer included with the package. The package now targets the NET452 TFM. The duty cycle and polarity can now be set when the PWM pin is stopped. The frequency for the PWM controller can now be set at any time. PwmController.SetDesiredFrequency and PwmController.ActualFrequency now return the actual frequency the device was able to meet. The min and max frequency for PWM is now returned correctly. Removed analog input and output precision. Added G120, G120E, and FEZ Cobra III. CAN bus definitions now return a friendly name instead of an integer. Renamed Gpio to GpioPin, AnalogInput to AdcChannel, AnalogOutput to DacChannel, and PwmOutput to PwmPin. The pe and pdbx files are no longer included with the package. The package now targets the NET452 TFM. Known Issues Formatting numbers sometimes returns incorrect values. string.Format fails for non-trivial cases. There is only one PWM controller currently and since the Windows API has a controller-wide frequency, all PWM channels use the same frequency. Some frequencies may round up instead of down if the requested frequency cannot be met. Firmware Changes Added G120/G120E firmware. Flushing over USB is quicker. GPIO interrupts are now raised reliably. The maximum allocation is now 51,539,607,484 bytes. Known Issues PWM frequencies beyond 45MHz on G80 and 21MHz on G30 can fail. PWM may take up to a minute to start on G30 and G80. Extension Changes Breakpoints and the commands dependent on them now function properly. References no longer need a solution reload to deploy. The GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.MsBuild package has been removed. PDBX and PE files are now generated at deploy time. The deployment progress log shows more information. Incremental deployment is now better about deploying only what has changed. Debugging stops quicker after all threads in the application exit. The project templates now mirror the desktop templates much more closely. The Visual Studio projects now target .NET Framework v4.5.2. Known Issues Deploying an assembly larger than the flash sector size fails. An 0xA2000000 error will get sent over the debug transport whenever there is no app present. 0.1.0 on 2016-12-16 Known Issues After flashing the firmware the first time, Windows may still use the old NETMF USB IDs preventing the device from being seen by TinyCLR. Uninstall the device from the Device Manager and reinstall it to fix it. To update the firmware on pre-Windows 10 machines, you will need the bootloader drivers provided by our existing 2016 R1 NETMF SDK . Breakpoints and the commands dependent on them (run to cursor, others) do not work. As a work around, add a class library project called mscorlib to your solution and add a project reference to it or insert calls to System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Break. References can fail to deploy unless a solution close and open occurs after adding the reference. Re-deploying immediately after stopping debugging can fail. Try again to work around it. There is only one PWM controller currently and since the Windows API has a controller-wide frequency, all PWM channels use the same frequency. PwmController.SetDesiredFrequency must be called before any call to PwmController.OpenPin. PwmPin.SetActiveDutyCyclePercentage must be called after Start. GPIO interrupts do not always trigger. PWM may take up to a minute to start. Formatting numbers yields incorrect results in some cases. string.Format fails for non-trivial cases. Only Core, Devices, and Pins libraries are available. Only G30 and G80 are available. Packages are not uploaded to the NuGet public gallery. Additions TimeSpan.Total* {int/long/double/...}.TryParse(string source, out value) string.Format(string format, param object[] args) System.Diagnostics.WriteLine(string message)"

Internally, the display controller automatically transfers (refreshes) the display directly from memory, without any processor interaction. When the system needs to update the graphics, it simply writes to memory. The operating system doesn't need to handle any display work. The down side to this is that the system needs to have enough RAM to handle the display. A 800x600 display with 16bpp needs 960,000 bytes! This should be no issues for systems with external memory. TinyCLR OS built in graphics can be used with these displays. You need to add the GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Drawing NuGet package and also this in your code: using System.Drawing and using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Display var displayController = DisplayController.GetDefault(); // Enter the proper display configurations displayController.ApplySettings(new LcdControllerSettings { Width = 480, Height = 272, PixelClockRate = 20000000, PixelPolarity = false, OutputEnablePolarity = true, OutputEnableIsFixed = false, HorizontalFrontPorch = 2, HorizontalBackPorch = 2, HorizontalSyncPulseWidth = 41, HorizontalSyncPolarity = false, VerticalFrontPorch = 2, VerticalBackPorch = 2, VerticalSyncPulseWidth = 10, VerticalSyncPolarity = false, }); // Some needed objects var screen = Graphics.FromHdc(displayController.Hdc); var GreenPen = new Pen(Color.Green); // Start Drawing (to memroy) screen.Clear(Color.Black); screen.DrawEllipse(GreenPen, 40, 30, 20, 10); // Flush the memory to the display. This is a very fast operation. screen.Flush(); Serial SPI/I2C Displays Serial displays can work on all microcontrollers. They use the very common SPI or I2C busses. These displays have built in memory buffers, freeing resources from the system. However, updating graphics is significantly slower than using Parallel TFT Displays. The system will have to send serial commands to identify the memory region to update and then follow that with the new data. This is why serial display are usually smaller displays. To the system, the serial display is nothing but a serial device. You are expected to write the code to handle graphics. A good example is the Adafruit Display Shield which uses a SPI display. This video features a very low cost I2C display option"

The ratio of the pulse width and its frequency is called duty cycle. Through software, you can control the pulse's frequency and duty cycle. Tip We usually use GetDefault() for most peripherals. For example, there is only one GPIO controller on most systems. This is not the case with PWM. Never use the Default controller and always select the proper channel on the corresponding controller. Tip PWM2.3 is channel 3 on controller 2 Energy Level PWM is perfect for dimming an LED or slowing down a motor. This is done by turning power on and off, at a high speed.

    "keywords": "Porting TinyCLR TinyCLR OS can be ported to new devices. We provide the precompiled .NET interpreter and runtime for several architectures. Currently Cortex M3, Cortex M4, ARM7, and ARM9 are supported. To get started we'll build the FEZCLR firmware that the FEZ uses. Clone the ports repo to your computer. If you're new to git or haven't even heard of it, take a look at the Git Book to learn more about it. Download and install GCC . The latest version we have tested is 6-2017-q2-update . Download and extract the contents of CMSIS into the CMSIS folder of the cloned repo. While the file extension is *.pack , it's actually a zip that you can extract once you rename it to *.zip . Download and extract the latest TinyCLR OS Core Library into the Core folder of the cloned repo. Open a command prompt, change the directory to the cloned repo, and then execute build.bat FEZCLR . The compiled firmware can then be found in the repo directory under build\\release\\FEZCLR . The build system automatically produces firmware images in hex format (.hex), a raw binary (.bin), and either a binary meant to be loaded by our GHI Bootloader with its U command (.glb) or a binary meant to be loaded by the same bootloader with the X command (.ghi). For the FEZCLR firmware we built, flash the FEZCLR Firmware.glb to your FEZ following the instructions on the bootloader page. When you restart it, it should be running TinyCLR OS and you can deploy to it from Visual Studio. Creating your own device To create a new firmware for a board that a Target already exists for, you just need to create a new folder under Devices to define your board. You can do this easily by copying an existing board, like the FEZ, and making the changes you need for your board. Make sure you update the scatterfile to place the final firmware image in memory where it needs to be. For example, the FEZ scatterfile expects the GHI Bootloader to be present but you need to place your firmware's image at the start of flash. To make using a custom port easier, we're specifically making the USB product ID 0x5000 under our vendor ID (0x1B9F) available for anyone to use for the USB debug interface on their TinyCLR device. Make sure to only use this product ID because other product IDs are assigned by us for our own use. Of course, if you have your own vendor ID, you are free to use it. So when you copy an existing device to make a new one, be sure to verify the USB vendor and product IDs are correct. Creating a new target To port to a new board with a new Target , make sure it is one of the architectures that we have made a core library available for. Then, like above, you'll need to make a new folder for your device under the Devices folder. You'll also need to create a new folder under Targets that implements the needed APIs. The TinyCLR runtime requires you to provide a few APIs for it to function correctly: deployment, interrupt, power, and time. The runtime also makes a few APIs available to you automatically: the API provider itself; a memory allocator; a recurring task creator; and a way to interact with managed objects, arguments, and events. Beyond that, you can provide whatever APIs you need like GPIO and SPI. See the native API document for details on APIs. On top of providing several APIs, you must call all the functions under TinyCLR_Startup_* to properly initialize the system. The main.cpp provided in the repo that our existing ports use and the build system includes is a good starting point."

    "title": "Native APIs in TinyCLR",
    "keywords": "Native APIs in TinyCLR The TinyCLR runtime provides several built in APIs for you to use and allows you to register APIs of your own that other parts of the system can later use. These APIs are also exposed to managed code to query and use. Looking inside the TinyCLR.h file provided in the porting repo, you'll see several types defined under TinyCLR_Api_Type . Each of those types has an associated provider somewhere else in the file that defines its API. The GPIO API for example allows you to read and write a pin that that provider has. APIs can also be set as the default API for a given type. This makes it easier for managed code to get access to a resource without knowing the exact name. Notice also that APIs are all defined as a struct with a field to access the owning API and a number of function pointers that provide the API. Most function pointers in avaialble APIs take a pointer to the owning struct as a this reference, since one is not implicitly provided because they're not traditional classes with instance members. Ports will register various providers to expose some functionality to other parts of the system, including native code. Our GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices library allows you to specify which native provider you want to use and will automatically acquire and interface with it. It also uses the default API functionality to power the various GetDefault methods. All access to APIs is handled by the TinyCLR_Api_Provider type that is passed to the TinyCLR_Startup_SoftResetHandler you register. The base function to find APIs is Find . You provide it an API name and the type that API should be and then it returns a TinyCLR_Api_Info type if it is found, or nullptr otherwise. The info struct contains information on the API like name, author, version, and type. It may also provide zero or more implementations specified by the Count field. When providing zero implementations, Implementation is nullptr . When providing one, Implementation points direcetly to the an instance of the corresponding API struct. If providing more than one, it points to an array of pointers, each of which its a pointer to an instance of the corresponding API struct. The functions SetDefaultSelector and GetDefaultSelector allow you to set and get the default selector used for a given API type. A selector takes the form \"{API name}{API index}\" (excluding the braces). This selector can be used by the FindBySelector method. It'll look for an API with the given name and then find the implementation with the given index, making sure not to go out of bounds for the specified API. FindByIndex does the same thing except you manually provide it with the name and index. FindByDefault finds the default selector for the type if present and returns the API implementation it corresponds to. You can also add your own API using the Add function. Just provide it with a pointer to a TinyCLR_Api_Info struct that is properly constructed and it can later be found by calls to Find . You can add APIs from within native interops or your own native code if you're building your own firmware. The below code shows you how to find and interact with the default GPIO provider in the system. It assumes one is present and that the API provider is available as a global variable in your code. void gpioTest() { auto gpioProvider = (const TinyCLR_Gpio_Provider*)apiProvider->FindDefault(apiProvider, TinyCLR_Api_Type::GpioProvider); if (gpioProvider != nullptr) { gpioProvider->AcquirePin(gpioProvider, 0); gpioProvider->WritePin(gpioProvider, 0, TinyCLR_Gpio_PinValue::High); gpioProvider->ReleasePin(gpioProvider, 0); } }"

They can be inputs or outputs, hence the name general purpose input output, or GPIO for short. Tip GPIO is handled by using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio through the Devices NuGet package. Digital Outputs A digital output pin can be set to either high or low. There are different ways of describing these two states. High can also be called \"true\" or \"one;\" low can be called \"false\" or \"zero\". If the processor is powered from 3.3V, then the state high means that there is 3.3V on the output pin. It is not going to be exactly 3.3V but very close. When the pin is set to low then it is voltage is very close to zero volts. Warning Never connect two output pins together. If they are connected and one is high and the other is low, the entire processor can be damaged. Warning Digital pins on microcontrollers are weak. They can only be used to control small LEDs or transistors. Those transistors can in turn control devices with high power needs, like a motor. This example will blink an LED on FEZ. using System.Threading; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio; class Program { static void Main() { GpioPin led = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin( GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins.FEZ.GpioPin.Led1); led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output); while (true) { led.Write(GpioPinValue.High); Thread.Sleep(100); led.Write(GpioPinValue.Low); Thread.Sleep(100); } } } The previous example use the FEZ pin class that includes enumerate all pins available on FEZ.

As every port has 16 pins, we can calculate the pin as shown. using System; using System.Threading; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio; class Program { static int PinNumber(char port, byte pin) { if (port < 'A' || port > 'E') throw new ArgumentException(); return ((port - 'A')*16) + pin; } static void Main() { var led = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin( //PinNumber('E', 2));// Buggy bot right flash //PinNumber('C', 4));// Buggy bot left flash //PinNumber('C', 12));// mini M4 //PinNumber('B', 2));// Cerbuino //PinNumber('A', 1));// clicker //PinNumber('E', 12));// clicker2 //PinNumber('E', 15));// Quail //PinNumber('A', 10));//netduino 3 //PinNumber('D', 5));//411 red Discovery //PinNumber('D', 15));//411 blue Discovery STM32F4.GpioPin.PA15); led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output); while(true) { led.Write(GpioPinValue.High); Thread.Sleep(100); led.Write(GpioPinValue.Low); Thread.Sleep(100); } } } Digital Inputs Digital inputs sense if the state of its pin is high or low based on the voltage. Every pin has a maximum & minimum supported voltage. For example, the typical minimum voltage on most pins is 0 volts; a negative voltage may damage the pin or the processor. Also, the maximum that can be supplied to most pins must be less than the processor power source voltage. Since most processors run on 3.3V, the highest voltage a pin should see is 3.3V; however, some processors that are powered by 3.3V are 5V tolerant; that is, they can accept up to 5V on their inputs. FEZ is 5V tolerant. Warning 5V-tolerant doesn't mean the processor can be powered by 5V. Only the input pins can tolerate 5V. Unconnected input pins are called \"floating\" as they are open for any surrounding noise, which can make the pin high or low. A resistor can be added to pull the pin high or low. Modern processors include internal pull-down or pull-up resistors, that are controlled by software. Note that the pull-up resistor doesn't make a pin high but it pulls it high. If nothing is connected then the pin is high by default. In this example, a button is connected between ground and the input pin. We will also enable the pull-up resistor, making that pin high when the button is not pressed, and low when the button is pressed. We will read the status of the button and pass its state to the LED. Tip Never use an infinite loop without giving the system time to think, use events or simply add a small sleep. using System; using System.Threading; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins; class Program { static void Main() { GpioController GPIO = GpioController.GetDefault(); GpioPin led = GPIO.OpenPin(FEZ.GpioPin.Led1); led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output); GpioPin button = GPIO.OpenPin(FEZ.GpioPin.Btn1); button.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.InputPullUp); while(true) { if(button.Read() == GpioPinValue.Low) { // button is pressed led.Write(GpioPinValue.High); } else { led.Write(GpioPinValue.Low); } Thread.Sleep(10);//always give the system time to think! } } } Tip if you are not using FEZ, see the Output Port example above to see how to determine the pin number. Digital Input Events In the previous example, the program just looped, and looped, and looped; each time checking the status of the pin attached to the button. The pin is checked maybe a million times before the button is pressed! Events solves this by invoking (calling) a method when an event occur. In this case the event is raised when the value on an input pin is changed. Meaning a button is pressed or released. A RisingEdge happen when the state of a pin changes from low to high, it \"rises\". This is the same button controlling LED example, but using events. using System; using System.Threading; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins; class Program { static GpioPin led; static void Main() { GpioController GPIO = GpioController.GetDefault(); led = GPIO.OpenPin(FEZ.GpioPin.Led1); led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output); GpioPin button = GPIO.OpenPin(FEZ.GpioPin.Btn1); button.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.InputPullUp); button.ValueChanged += Button_ValueChanged; Thread.Sleep(-1);// sleep for low power, or do other tasks here! } private static void Button_ValueChanged(GpioPin sender, GpioPinValueChangedEventArgs e) { if (e.Edge == GpioPinEdge.FallingEdge) led.Write(GpioPinValue.Low); else led.Write(GpioPinValue.High); } } Warning Once you type += after the event, hit the tab key twice. Visual Studio will automatically create the event for you."

    "title": "UART",
    "keywords": "UART Serial data ports, called UART, transfers data between two pins TXD (transmit) and RXD (receive). There is no clock between the two sides so they both need to agree on the data slow rate, called baudrate. Tip the TXD on one end (output) goes to the RXD on the other side (input) and vice versa. The easiest way to test UART is by wiring TXD to RXD and then any data transmitted is also received. This demo will send a number every half a second and wait for it on the receive end. Tip Serial uses Storage Streams to handle the data. Add the Storage NuGet package. using System; using System.Diagnostics; using System.Threading; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Storage.Streams; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.SerialCommunication; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins; class Program { static DataReader serReader; static DataWriter serWriter; static void Sender() { byte b = 0; while(true) { serWriter.WriteByte(b++); serWriter.Store(); Debug.WriteLine(\"Sent: \" + b); Thread.Sleep(500); } } static void Main() { SerialDevice ser = SerialDevice.FromId(FEZ.UartPort.Usart1); ser.BaudRate = 115200; ser.ReadTimeout = TimeSpan.Zero; serReader = new DataReader(ser.InputStream); serWriter = new DataWriter(ser.OutputStream); Thread SenderT = new Thread(Sender); SenderT.Start(); while (true) { var i = serReader.Load(1); if(i>0) { byte b = serReader.ReadByte(); Debug.WriteLine(\"Recieved: \" + b); } Thread.Sleep(10);// always give the system time to think! } } } RS232 UART uses the processor's voltage levels for transferring data, called TTL voltage levels. Systems from back in the 80s needed a way to transfer data over long distances and so the UART levels changed to be -12V to +12V instead of TTL 0V to 3.3V on FEZ for example. This standard is called RS232. Some PCs still include serial ports to this day, but those are RS232 serial ports. A level shifter chip is needed to convert the voltages properly. Warning connecting your circuit to RS232 port without proper level shifter wil damage your circuit."

It is simple enough that a beginner can start with, but powerful that an advanced user can use it to expand their knowledge. It works with higher elementary kids to a retired person. Visit the official BrainPad website at www.brainpad.com This video shows a 6-year-old using a PC for the first time! And her first PC experience was in programming the BrainPad. The BrainPad design is based on the TinYCLR OS's official FEZ hardware. This means that the BrainPad will always receive the latest TinyCLR OS updates. The Future Plan We want your feedback. After years of work with hundreds of students, the BrainPad setup is simple and works through the TinyCLR OS ecosystem of boards. However, we are constantly working on making the use of the BrainPad yet simpler. This video shows one of the schools we worked with: The Community We have been working with local and online communities for years. Hop on our forum and share the discussion now. Or talk to us directly about our next local community gathering. Teachers and students like you are also interested in STEM & STEAM. Firmware Update Using TinyCLR Config (coming soon) Manual Loading the Firmware TinyCLR Config tool should be used to update the firmware. As a backup, use the instructions on the bootloader page for manual update. Here is a video that shows the manual firmware update. It also includes the steps needed for the old BrainPad and steps for updating the bootloader. The BrainPad uses the FEZCLR firmware Advance Hardware Info Advance hardware info are found on the hardware page. Also, learn about the magic TinyCLR OS . The Original BrainPad The Original (old) BrainPad (the large one) has been decommissioned. It has served well in working with schools to help us make a lot of decisions. Tip You can determine if you have the old BrainPad by looking for the traffic light in the top right corner. Only the old BrainPad has the traffic light. As a bonus, we will continue to support the original BrainPad with the new software. However, emulating the old display with the new software is severely effecting the system's performance. The display will not be enabled by default. We do not recommend the use of display on the old BrainPad. Using the Traffic Light The new software does not include the traffic light as the new BrainPad doesn't have a traffic light. However, this can be added as shown in this video."
