# Roadmap

Since TinyCLR OS is still in early alpha, we will be adding more libraries and functionality over time. Some of the things on our wish list in no particular order:

- USB host and client
- File system
- Graphics
- Secure networking
- Device updating
- Controller Area Network
- Runtime Loadable Procedures
- Generics
- .NET Standard

The focus now is on making the core essentials available for many devices to prove the stability and portability of the core.
