# Roadmap

Since TinyCLR OS is still so new, we will be adding more libraries and functionality over time. Some of the things on our wish list in no particular order:

- USB host and client
- File system
- Graphics
- Secure networking
- Device updating
- Controller Area Network
- Runtime Loadable Procedures
- Generics
- .NET Standard
