# Clicker
The Clicker board from Mikro Elekronika, and other similar products listed on this page, all run TinyCLR OS. You will be loading TinyCLR OS on these boards using the [Mikro bootloader](../../hardware/loaders/mikro_bootloader.md). 

> [!Tip]
> The loader will wait for a few seconds on every power up before it runs TinyCLR OS. If this delay is not desirable, use an ST-Link programmer to flash the firmware onto the board directly, overwriting the bootloader.
