# STM32F4 Discovery Boards

## STM32F411 Discovery

The [STM32F411 Discovery board]( http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f411ediscovery.html) is a low-cost board with a built in native debugging support, called ST-Link. This is a good, especially for users wanting to port TinyCLR OS and in need for debugging TinyCLR OS native port.

Use the [ST DFU tool](http://docs.ghielectronics.com/hardware/stm32_bootloader.html) to load the "FEZ firmware" onto your discovery board. When done, your PC should detect a TinyCLR device. You are now ready to start coding http://docs.ghielectronics.com/tinyclr/tutorials/intro.html

Note that we are using the same FEZ firmware. Peripherals are mapped exactly to how they are on the 
[FEZ board](http://docs.ghielectronics.com/hardware/fez.html) 


 

## STM32F407 Discovery

The [STM32F407 discovery board](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html) is very close to the STM32411. 

To 
[run TinyCLR OS](http://docs.ghielectronics.com/tinyclr/boards/stm32f411_discovery.html), follow the same instructions as the STM32F411 discovery board
