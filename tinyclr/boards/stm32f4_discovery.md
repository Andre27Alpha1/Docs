# STM32F4 Discovery Boards

ST Microelectronics provides low-cost evaluation and reference boards for their STM32 microcontrollers, called discovery boards. All discovery boards are very close and similar, allowing TinyCLR OS to run on all of them; however, this page includes the discovery board we have tested.

The discovery boards include a built-in native debugging support, called ST-Link. This is a good option for users wanting to port TinyCLR OS and in need for debugging TinyCLR OS native port.

## STM32F411 Discovery

The [STM32F411 Discovery board]( http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f411ediscovery.html)

This discovery board uses essentially the same microcontroller found on FEZ. Follow the same instructions as [FEZ board](http://docs.ghielectronics.com/tinyclr/boards/fez.html)


## STM32F407 Discovery

The microcontroller on this discovery board is very similar to the one used on FEZ (STM32F401). Follow the same instructions as [FEZ board](http://docs.ghielectronics.com/tinyclr/boards/fez.html)
