# clicker 2

Mikro Elekronika's [cicker 2 for STM32](https://shop.mikroe.com/clicker-2-stm32f4) board includes dual [mikroBUS](https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus/) socket, for quickly adding one of many available [click modules](https://shop.mikroe.com/click).

The board comes pre-flashed with a [bootloader](https://learn.mikroe.com/bootloaders/) for an easy and quick way to load your firmware, TinyCLR OS in our case. Simply open the bootloader tool and load the TinyCLR OS firmware file.

> [!Tip]
> The loader will wait for a few seconds on every power up before it runs TinyCLR OS. If this delay is not desirable, use an ST-Link programmer to flash the firmware onto the board directly, overwriting the bootloader.

> [!Warning]
> clicker and clicker 2 boards use different processors and different system clock. Each board has its own TinyCLR OS firmware.
