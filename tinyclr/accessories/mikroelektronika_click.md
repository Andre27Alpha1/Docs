Through Mikro Electronica's [mikroBUS standard](https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus/), hundreds of [Mikro's Click modules](https://shop.mikroe.com/click) can be easily connected to your board.

The [BrainPad](../../brainpad/intro.md), [Clicker](../boards/clicker.md) and [Quail](../boards/quail.md) boards all have sockets for plugging click modules. You can also use [FEZ](../../hardware/products/fez.md), or any other Arduino-pinout compatible board through the [Arduino UNO Click shield](https://shop.mikroe.com/arduino-uno-click-shield)

Current available Click module drivers:
- [FM Radio click](https://shop.mikroe.com/fm-click)
- [Touch Clamp](https://shop.mikroe.com/touchclamp-click)
- [Alcohol sensor](https://shop.mikroe.com/alcohol-click)

This example shows the FM Radio working with the FEZ through the uno click shield
