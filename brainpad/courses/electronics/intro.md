# Intro

Electronics is in everything around us. What is surprising is that, in this modern age, we have more electronic devices but there is a lot less fixing of these electronic devices, when compared to the previous generations.

Can we educate the next generation to understand electronics better? The BrainPad, without any additions, is enough to explain all the basics. Then it can also be used to explain digital electronics and processing. Further going into explain data transfers in digital system. This is all before even adding a single wire, but then the possibilities are endless with what sensors and circuits can be wired to the BrainPad.

These are the outdated courses that are getting updated soon. Please bear with us.
